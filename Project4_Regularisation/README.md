Description:

This mini project contains source code that demonstrates the effect
 of regularisation techniques on the performance of a machine 
 learning model (as far as classification accuracy is concerned). A
  Support Vector Machine model optimized via Batch Stochastic Gradient 
  Descent has been trained on the animals image dataset used in 
  [Project 1](https://github.com/nombreinvicto/DeepLearningCV/tree/master/Project1_knn)
  to particularly show the difference in the effects of the model 
  accuracy when using [L1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regularization_(mathematics) 
  and L2 regularization techniques. It was observed that the 
  implementation of regularisation does 
  infact yield higher model accuracy towards unseen test data, with
   L2 giving better performance over L1.
