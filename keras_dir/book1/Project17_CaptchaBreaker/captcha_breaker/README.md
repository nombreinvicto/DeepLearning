Description:

This repository contains Python coded source codes for:
 
 
* The implementation of a training script that trains a LeNet architecture
 Convoluted Neural Network model on Captcha digits dataset formed from the
  assimilation of captcha images from the EZ-Pass NY website. A training and
   testing accuracy of around 100% was obtained after 20 epochs of training
   . The image below shows the training and testing accuracy and loss trends
    over the predetermined epochs.
