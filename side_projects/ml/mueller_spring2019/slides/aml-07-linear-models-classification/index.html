# Linear Models for Classification, SVMs

02/12/19

Andreas C. Müller

???
Today we're going to talk about linear models for
classification, and in addition to that some general
principles and advanced topics surrounding general models,
both for classification and regression.

FIXME: in regularizing SVM, long vs short normal vectors.
FIXME do we need ovo? we kinda do, right?

# Linear models for <strong>binary</strong> classfication

???
We'll first start with linear models for binary
classification, so if there are only two classes. That makes
the models much easier to understand.

---
.center[
![:scale 55%](images/linear_boundary_vector.png)
]

$$\hat{y} = \text{sign}(w^T \textbf{x} + b) = \text{sign}\left(\sum\limits_{i}w_ix_i + b\right)$$

???
Similar to the regression case, basically all linear models
for classification have the same way to make predictions. As
with regression, they compute an inner product of a weight
vector w with the feature vector x, and add some bias b. The
result of that is a real number, as in regression. For
classification, however, we only look at the sign of the
result, so whether it is negative or positive. If it's
positive, we predict one class, usually called +1, if it's
negative, we predict the other class, usually called -1. If
the result is 0, by convention the positive class is
predicted, but because it's a floating point number that
doesn't really happen in practice. You'll see that sometimes
in my notation I will not have a $b$. That's because you can
always add a constant feature to x to achieve the same
effect (thought you would then need to leave that feature
out of the regularization). So when I write $w^Tx$ without a
$b$ assume that there is a constant feature added that is
not part of any regularization.

Geometrially, what the formula means is that the decision
boundary of a linear classifier will be a hyperplane in the
feature space, where w is the normal vector of that plane.
In the 2d example here, it's just a line separating red and
blue. Everything on the right hand side would be classified
as blue by this classifier, and everything on the left-hand
side as red.

Questions? So again, the learning here consists of finding
parameters w and b based on the training set, and that is
where the different algorithms differ. There are quite a lot
of algorithms out there, and there are also quite a lot in
scikit-learn, but we'll only discuss the most common ones.

The most straight-forward way to approach finding w and b is
to use the framework of empirical risk minimization that we
talked about last time, so finding parameters that minimize
some loss o the training set. Where classification differs
quite a bit from regression is on how we want to measure
misclassifications.


---

# Picking a loss?

$$\hat{y} = \text{sign}(w^T \textbf{x} + b)$$

`$$\min_{w \in ℝ^{p}, b \in \mathbb{R}} \sum_{i=1}^n 1_{y_i \neq \text{sign}(w^T \textbf{x} + b)}$$`

.center[
![:scale 40%](images/binary_loss.png)
]

???
So we need to define a loss function for given w and b that
tell us how well they fit the training set. Obvious Idea:
Minimize number of misclassifications aka 0-1 loss but this
loss is non-convex, not continuous and minimizing it is
NP-hard. So we need to relax it, which basically means we
want to find a convex upper bound for this loss. This is not
done on the actual prediction, but on the inner product $w^T
x$, which is also called the decision function. So this
graph here has the inner product on the x axis, and shows
what the loss would be for class 1. The 0-1 loss is zero if
the decision function is positive, and one if it's negative.
Because a positive decision function means a positive
predition, means correct classification in the case of y=1.
A negative prediction means a wrong classification, which is
penalized by the 0-1 loss with a loss of 1, i.e. one
mistake.

The other losses we'll talk about are mostly the hinge loss
and the log loss. You can see they are both upper bounds on
the 0-1 loss but they are convex and continuous. Both of
these losses care not only that you make a correct
prediction, but also "how correct" your prediction is, i.e.
how positive or negative your decision function is. We'll
talk a bit more about the motivation of these two losses,
starting with the logistic loss.

# Logistic Regression


.left-column[
$$\log\left(\frac{p(y=1|x)}{p(y=0|x)}\right) = w^T\textbf{x} + b$$

$$p(y=1|\textbf{x}) = \frac{1}{1+e^{-w^T\textbf{x} -b }}$$

`$$\min_{w \in ℝ^{p}, b \in \mathbb{R}} -\sum_{i=1}^n \log(\exp(-y_i(w^T \textbf{x}_i + b)) + 1)$$`


$$\hat{y} = \text{sign}(w^T\textbf{x} + b)$$
]
.right-column[
![:scale 90%](images/logit.png)]


???
Logistic regression is probably the most commonly used
linear classifier, maybe the most commonly used classifier
overall. The idea is to model the log-odds, which is log
p(y=1|x) - log p(y=0|x) as a linear function, as shown here.
Rearranging the formula, you get a model of p(y=1|x) as 1
over 1 + ... This function is called the logistic sigmoid,
and is drawn to the right here. Basically it squashed the
linear function $w^Tx$ between 0 and 1, so that it can model
a probability.

Given this equation for p(y|x), what we want to do is
maximize the probability of the training set under this
model. This approach is known as maximum likelihood.
Basically you want to find w and b such that they assign
maximum probability to the labels observed in the training
data. You can rearrange that a bit and end up with this
equation here, which contains the log-loss as seen on the
last slide.

The prediction is the class with the higher probability. In
the binary case, that's the same as asking whether the
probability of class 1 is bigger or smaller than .5. And as
you can see from the plot of the logistic sigmoid, the
probability of the class +1 is greater than .5 exactly if
the decision function $w^T x$ is greater than 0. So
predicting the class with maximum probability is the same as
predicting which side of the hyperplane given by w we are
on.

Ok so this is logistic regression. We minimize this loss and
get a w which defines a hyper plane. But if you think back
to last time, this is only part of what we want. This
formulation tries to fit the training data, but it doesn't
care about finding a simple solution.

# Penalized Logistic Regression

`$$\min_{w \in ℝ^{p}, b \in \mathbb{R}}-C \sum_{i=1}^n\log(\exp(-y_i(w^T \textbf{x}_i + b )) + 1) + ||w||_2^2$$`

`$$\min_{w \in ℝ^{p}, b \in \mathbb{R}}-C \sum_{i=1}^n\log(\exp(-y_i (w^T \textbf{x}_i + b)) + 1) + ||w||_1$$`

- C is inverse to alpha (or alpha / n_samples)


???

- Both versions strongly convex, l2 version smooth (differentiable).

- All points contribute to $w$ (dense solution to dual).

So we can do the same we did for regression: we can add
regularization terms using the L1 and L2 norm. The effects
are the same as for regression: both push the coefficients
towards zero, but the l1 norm encourages coefficients to be
exactly zero, for the same reasons we discussed last time.

You could also use a mixed penalty to get something like the
elasticnet. That's not implemented in the logisticregression
class in scikit-learn right now, but it's certainly a
sensible thing to do.

Here I used a slightly different notation as last time,
though. I'm not using alpha to multiply the regularizer,
instead I'm using C to multiply the loss. That's mostly
because that's how it's done in scikit-learn and it has only
historic reasons. The idea is exactly the same, only now C
is 1 over alpha. So large C means heavy weight to the loss,
means little regularization, while small C means less weight
on the loss, means strong regularization.

Depending on the model, there might be a factor of n_samples
in there somewhere. Usually we try to make the objective as
independent of the number of samples as possible in
scikit-learn, but that might lead to surprises if you're not
aware of it.

Some side-notes on the optimization problem: here, as in
regression, having more regularization makes the
optimization problem easier. You might have seen this in
your homework already, if you decrease C, meaning you add
more regularization, your model fits more quickly.

One particular property of the logistic loss, compared to
the hinge loss we'll discuss next is that each data point
contributes to the loss, so each data point has an effect on
the solution. That's also true for all the regression models
we saw last time.

# Effect of regularization


.center[
![:scale 90%](images/logreg_regularization.png)
]

- Small C (a lot of regularization) limits the influence of individual points!

???

So I spared you with coefficient plots, because they looks
the same as for regression. All the things I said about
model complexity and dependency on the number of features
and samples is as true for classification as it is for
regression.

There is another interesting way to thing about
regularization that I found helpful, though. I'm not going
to walk through the math for this, but you can reformulate
the optimization problem and find that what the C parameter
does is actually limit the influence of individual data
points. With very large C, we said we have no
regularization. It also means individual data points can
have basically unlimited influence, as you can see here.
There are two outliers here, which basically completely tilt
the decision boundary. But if we decrease C, and therefore
increase the regularization, what happens is that the
influence of these outlier points becomes limited, and the
other points get more influence.

#Max-Margin and Support Vectors

.center[

???
A point is within the margin if 〖y_i w〗^T x is smaller
than one. That means if you have a smaller w, you basically
have a smaller margin given that you're on the correct side.
If you're on the wrong side, you'll have always have a loss.
If you're in the correct side, if you're w^x is small, then
you also have a loss.

$$\text{Within margin} \Leftrightarrow y_i(w^T x  + b)< 1$$

Smaller $w \Rightarrow$ larger margin

???
Here are two examples on the same dataset. Where I learned
linear support vector machine with c-0.1, and c=1. With
c=0.1, you have a wider margin. There are points inside the
margin and all the points inside the margin are support
vectors which contribute to the solution. Points that are
outside of the margin and on the correct side doesn't
contribute to the solution. These points are sort of
classified correctly, not when they’re ignored. The normal
vector is w and basically, the size of the margin is the
inverse of the length of w. C=0.1 means I have less emphasis
on the data fitting and more emphasis on the shrinking w.
This will lead to a smaller w. If I have larger C that means
less regularization, which will lead to a larger W, larger W
means a smaller margin. So there are fewer points here, they
are inside the margin and therefore, fewer support vectors.
More regularization usually means a larger margin but more
points inside the margin. Also, more support vectors mean
there are more data points that actually influence the
solution.

???


- Both versions strongly convex, neither smooth.

- Only some points contribute (the support vectors) to $w$ (sparse solution to dual).

Moving from logistic regression to linear SVMs is just a
matter of changing the loss from the log loss to the hinge
loss. The hinge-loss is defined as ... And we can penalize
using either l1 or l2 norm, or again, in principle also
elastic net. This formulation with the hinge loss doesn't
really make sense without the penalty, because of the
formulation of the hinge loss. What this loss says is
basically "if you predict the right class with a margin of
1, there is no loss". Otherwise the loss is linear in the
decision function. So you need to be on the right side of
the hyperplane by a given amount, and then there is no more
loss. That's the reason you need the penalty, for the 1 to
make sense. Otherwise you could just scale up $w$ to make it
far enough on the right side. But the regularization
penalizes growing $w$.

The hinge loss has a kink, same as the l1 norm, and so it's
not a smooth optimization problem any more, but that's not
really a big deal. What's interesting is that all the points
that are classified correctly with a margin of at least 1
have a loss of zero, and so they don't influence the
solution any more. All the point that are not classified
correctly by this margin are the ones that do influence the
solution and they are called the support vectors.

So this is the main difference between logistic regression
and linear SVMs: Does it penalize misclassifications
according to the green line, or according to the blue line?
In practice it doesn't make a big difference.

# SVM or LogReg?

.center[
![:scale 80%](images/svm_or_lr.png)

- Need compact model or believe solution is sparse? Use L1

???
So which one of them should you use? If you need probability
estimates, you should use logistic regression. If you don't,
you can pick either, and it doesn't really matter. Logistic
regression can be a bit faster to optimize in theory. If
you're in a setting where there's many more feature than
samples, it might make sense to use linear SVMs and solve
the dual, but you can actually solve either of the problems
in the dual, and we'll talk about what that means in
practice in a little bit.

# Multiclass classification


???

Ok, so I think that's enough on the two loss functions and
regularization, and hopefully you have a bit of a feel for
how these two classifiers work, and also an understanding
that they are in fact quite similar in practice.

Next I want to look at how to go from binary classification
to multi-class classification. Basically there is a simple
but hacky way, and there's a slightly more complicated but
theoretically sound way.

# Reduction to Binary Classification
.padding-top[

The slightly hacky way is using what's known as a reduction.
We're doing a reduction like in math: reducing one problem
to another. In this case we're reducing the problem of
multi-class classification into several instances of the
binary classification problem. And we already know how to
deal with binary classification.

There are two straight-forward ways to reduce multi-class to
binary classification. the first is called one vs rest, the
second one is called one-vs-one.

# One Vs Rest

For 4 classes:

1v{2,3,4}, 2v{1,3,4}, 3v{1,2,4}, 4v{1,2,3}

In general:

n binary classifiers - each on all data

???
FIXME terrible slide

Let's start with One vs Rest. here, we learn one binary
classifier for each class against the remaining classes. So
let's say we have 4 classes, called 1 to 4.  First we learn
a binary classifier of the points in class 1 vs the points
in the classes 2, 3 and 4.  Then, we do the same for class
2, and so on. The way we end up building as many classifiers
as we have classes.

# Prediction with One Vs Rest


"Class with highest score"

$$\hat{y} = \text{arg}\max_{i \in Y} \textbf{w}_i\textbf{x} + b_i$$


???
To make a prediction, we compute the decision function of
all classifiers, say 4 in the example, on a new data point.
The one with the highest score for the positive class, the
single class, wins, and that class is predicted.

It's a little bit unclear why this works as well as it does.
Maybe there's some papers about that now, but I'm not

So in this case we have one coefficient vector w and one
bias b for each class.

---

# One vs Rest Prediction

.center[
![:scale 80%](images/ovr_lines.png)
]


???
Here is an illustration of what that looks like.
Unfortunately it's a bit hard to draw 4 classes in general
position in 2 dimensions, so I only used 3 classes here. So
each class has an associated coefficient vector and bias,
corresponding to a line. The line tries to separate this
class from the other two classes.
# Fixme draw ws?

# One vs Rest Prediction

.center[
![:scale 80%](images/ovr_boundaries.png)
]


???

Here are the decision boundaries resulting from the these
three binary classifiers. Basically what they say is that
the line that is closest decides the class. What you can not
see here is that each of the lines also have a magnitude
associated with them. It's not only the direction of the
normal vector that matters, but also the length. You can
think of that as some form of uncertainty attached to the
line.

# One Vs One

- 1v2, 1v3, 1v4, 2v3, 2v4, 3v4
- n * (n-1) / 2 binary classifiers - each on a fraction of the data


- "Vote for highest positives"
- Classify by all classifiers.
- Count how often each class was predicted.
- Return most commonly predicted class.
- Again - just a heuristic.


???
FIXME terrible slide

The other method of reduction is called one vs one. In one
vs one, we build one binary model for each pair of classes.
In the example of having four classes that is one for 1 vs
2, one for 1v3 and so on. So we end up with n * (n - 1) /2
binary classifiers. And each is trained only on the subset
of the data that belongs to these classes.

To make a prediction, we again apply all of the classifiers.
For each class we count how often one of the classifiers
predicted that class, and we predict the class with the most
votes.

Again, this is just a heuristic and there's not really a
good theoretical explanation why this should work.

# One vs One Prediction

![:scale 80%](images/ovo_lines.png)


???
Here is an example for predicting on three classes in 2d
using the one-vs-one heuristic. In the case of three
classes, there's also three pairs. Three is a bit of a
special case, with any more classes there would be more
classifiers than classes.

The dashed lines are colored according to the pair of
classes they separate. So the green and blue line separates
the green and blue classes. The data points belonging to the
grey class were not used in building this model at all.
---

class: center
# One vs One Prediction


![:scale 80%](images/ovo_boundaries.png)


???

Looking at the predictions made by the one vs one classifier
the correspondence to the binary decision boundaries is a
bit more clear than for the one vs rest heuristic, because
it only takes the actual boundaries into account, not the
length of the normal vectors. That makes it easier to
visualize the geometry, but it's also a bit of a downside of
the method because it means it discards any notion of
uncertainty that was present in the binary classifiers. The
decision boundary for each class is given by the two lines
that this class is involved in. So the grey class is bounded
by the green and grey line and the blue and grey line.

There is a triangle in the center in which there is one vote
for each of the classes.  In this implemenatation the tie is
broken to just always predict the first class, which is the
green one. That might not be the best tie breaking strategy,
but this is a relatively rare case, in particular if there's
more than three classes.

OVR and OVO are general heuristics not restricted to linear
models. They can be used whenever a binary model for
classification needs to be extended to the multi-class case.
For logistic regression, there is actually a natural
extension of the formulation, and we don't have to resort to
these hacks.

# Multinomial Logistic Regression

Probabilistic multi-class model:

`$$p(y=i|x) = \frac{e^{\textbf{w}_i^T\textbf{x} + b_i}}{\sum_{j=1}^k e^{\textbf{w}_j^T\textbf{x} + b_j}}$$`

`$$\min_{w \in ℝ^{pk}, b \in \mathbb{R}^k} -\sum_{i=1}^n \log(p(y=y_i|x_i, w, b))$$`

$$\hat{y} = \text{arg} \max_{i=1,...,k} \textbf{w}_i\textbf{x} + b_i$$

- Same prediction rule as OvR !

???
The binary logistic regression case can be generalized to
multinomial logistic regression, in which we model the
probability that i is one of the classes using this formula,
which is also known as softmax. The probability is
proportional to e to the minus $w^t x$ which is the same as
in the binary case. But now we need to normalize it so that
the sum over all classes is one. So we just divide it by
this sum.

# In sckit-learn

- OvO: only SVC
- OvR: default for all linear models, even LogisticRegression (deprecated)
- `LogisticRegression(multinomial=True)`
- `clf.decision_function` = $w^Tx + b$
- `logreg.predict_proba`
- `SVC(probability=True)` not great


???
All the models in scikit-learn have multi-class built-in and
most of them use One versus Rest. There's only one model
that uses One versus One which is SVC. The Kernel SVM uses
One versus One because of the authors of the SVM like that.
For historical reasons, logistic regression also uses One
versus Rest by default in scikit-learn. That's probably not
a good idea, but we can’t really change the default easily.
Usually, if you do multiclass you probably want to use
multinomial logistic regression and so you set multinomial
to true and then it does multinomial logistic regression.
Question: Does that make it run faster? Answer: Its unlikely
to make it run faster, but it makes it more theoretically
sound and gives you better probabilities. The probabilities
that come out of it, if you do OvR, are a complete hack in
the multi-class case but in the binary case, it’s the same.
Logistic regression also has a predict_prob method. This
method gives the probability estimates, so you get a vector
of length number of classes for each data point. You might
be tempted to do SVC (probability) equal to true. That is
something we're going to talk about in a couple of weeks.
This is is running calibration. Basically, this does the One
versus One SVM and then it builds a second model on top that
tries to estimate probabilities using built-in
cross-validation. This will take forever and the outcome
will probably be not that great. Don't do this unless you're
really sure this is what you want to do. If you want
probabilities just use logistic regression. predict_proba
gives you the probabilities. If you call predict_proba, it
will give you an array that has number of samples times
number of classes and these entries will sum to one. And the
prediction is just the arg max of these. You can call
predict which will give you arg max while predict_proba will
give you the probabilities as given by the model.

# Multi-Class in Practice


OvR and multinomial LogReg produce one coef per class:

In practice, I'm using logistic regression on the iris
dataset. We have 50 data points, 4 features, 3 classes, each
class has 50 samples, and we’re trying to classify different
kinds of irises. Here, I'm looking at logistic regression
and linear SVM, I built the model. So the coefficient W is
stored in coef on this score. Everything in scikit-learn
that's estimated from the data ends with an underscore. If
it doesn't, it wasn't learned from the data. So coef_ are
the coefficient that is learned by the model. They’re for
logistic regression and linear Support Vector Machine,
they're the same shape, three classes times four features
but they have different semantics

Here I’ve interpreted them. You can see the four features,
for each feature and for each class, you have a coefficient.
If the sepal width is big, then the setosa classifier is
happy. If the sepal with is small then versicolor will have
a large response. If the petal width is big then virginica
will have a large response. This is a bar plot after
coefficient vector here. This tells you what the classifier
has learned. This is maybe for a very simple problem this is
little much to look at but it's still way less to look at
for any other model. If you used a random forest or
something like that, there would be no way to visualize
what's happening.

# Solver choices

- Don’t use `SVC(kernel='linear')`, use `LinearSVC`
- For `n_features >> n_samples`: Lars (or LassoLars) instead of Lasso.
- For small n_samples (<10.000?), don’t worry.
- `LinearSVC`, `LogisticRegression`: `dual=False` if `n_samples >> n_features`
- `LogisticRegression(solver="sag")` for `n_samples` large.
- Stochastic Gradient Descent for `n_samples` really
large


???
Some of the things here are specific to scikit-learn and
some are not. Scikit-learn has SVC and the linear SVC, and
they're both support vector machines. SVC uses One versus
One while linear SVC uses one versus rest. SVC uses the
hinged loss while linear SVC uses squared hinge loss. Linear
SVC will provide faster results than SVC. If you want to do
regression with a large number of features, you should
probably use Lars or LassoLars, which allows you to do
feature selection much more quickly than Lasso. Generally,
if you have a few samples, don't worry, any model will find
and everything will be sparse. If you have, let's say 10,000
samples all linear models will be fast all the time.
Otherwise, use this for regression. For classification, if
the number of samples is much greater than the number of
features use dual=false. Basically, solving a dual problem
means solving something where there are as many variables as
the number of samples, that's the default. Whereas solving
the primal problem, so dual=false means solving something
that's with the number of variables as the same number of
features. If the number of features is big, dual should be
true, and if the number of samples is big dual should be
false. If you have really a whole lot of samples you can use
a recent solver called sag. This works really for really
large samples. So LogisticRegression(solver=”sag”) that can
use L1 or L2 penalties or whatever you want. Then finally,
if you have an extremely large amount of data you can use
Stochastic Gradient Descent. It has the STD classifier, STD
regressor, and hopefully, we'll have enough time to talk
about these today. But generally often setting dual to false
will help you a lot and setting the solver to something else
might help you. All of these basically give you the same
solution but only at different speeds. I want to talk about
some tips for getting cross-validation. There are some
built-in tools for doing quicker cross-validation for linear
models.

# Kernel SVMs

# Motivation

- Go from linear models to more powerful nonlinear ones.
- Keep convexity (ease of optimization).
- Generalize the concept of feature engineering.

???
The main motivation for kernel support vector machines is
that we want to go from linear models to nonlinear models
but we also want to have the same simple kernel optimization
to solve. So basically, the optimization problem we have to
solve from a kernel SVM is about as hard as a linear SVM. So
it's sort of very simple problem to solve. It’s much easier
than learning in neural networks for example. But we get
nonlinear decision boundaries. The idea behind this is to
generalize the concept of feature engineering. We'll see in
a little bit how, for example, kernels SVM with polynomial
kernels relate to using polynomials explicitly in your
feature engineering. Before we talk about kernels, I want to
talk a little bit more about linear support vector machines,
which we already discussed last week.

# Reminder on Linear SVM

`$$ \min_{w \in \mathbb{R}^p, b \in \mathbf{R}} C \sum_{i=1}^n \max(0, 1 - y_i (w^T\mathbf{x} +b)) + ||w||^2_2 $$`

$$ \hat{y} = \text{sign}(w^T \mathbf{x} + b)  $$


???
The idea behind the linear support vector machine is it's a
linear classifier, the minimization problem is up a hinge
loss, which is basically linear in the decision function
w^x. Basically, as long as you have a distance on the right
side of the hyper plane, that’s bigger than one, your data
point does not contribute to the loss. So you want all of
the points outside of this margin of one around the
separating hyper plane.


---

# Reformulate Linear Models

.smaller[
- Optimization Theory

$$ w = \sum_{i=1}^n \alpha_i \mathbf{x}_i $$

(alpha are dual coefficients. Non-zero for support vectors only)


$$ \hat{y} = \text{sign}(w^T \mathbf{x})  \Longrightarrow   \hat{y} = \text{sign}\left(\sum_i^{n}\alpha_i (\mathbf{x}_i^T  \mathbf{x})\right) $$

$$ \alpha_i <= C$$

]

???
Now I want to go from this linear model and extended to a
nonlinear model. The idea here is that with some
improvisation theory, you can find out that the W at the
optimum can be expressed as a linear combination of the data
points which is relatively straightforward to C. Expressing
W as a linear combination, these alphas are called dual
coefficients. Basically, you’re expressing the linear
weights as a linear combination of the data points with this
two coefficients alpha and you can show that these alpha are
only non-zero for the points that contribute to this
solution. So you can always write W as a linear combination
of the support vectors with some alphas. If you want you can
do this optimization problem either in trying to find W or
you can rewrite the optimization problem and you can try to
find these alphas. If you do this in terms of alphas, the
decision function can be rewritten like this. Instead of
looking at you w^T x, we just replace W transposed by the
sum over all the training data points x_i and then basically
we move the sum out of the inner products and we can see
that it's the sum over all the alpha i in the inner product
of the training data points  x_i was a test data point x.
Optimization theory also tells us that if I find the alpha w
to minimize this problem, then all the alpha i (s) will be
smaller than c. This is another way to say what I said last
time that basically c limits the influence of each data
point. So, if you have a smaller c the alpha i belong to
each training data point can only be as big as this c, and
so each of the data points has only limited influence.

# Introducing Kernels


$$\hat{y} = \text{sign}\left(\sum_i^{n}\alpha_i (\mathbf{x}_i^T  \mathbf{x})\right) \longrightarrow \hat{y} = \text{sign}\left(\sum_i^{n}\alpha_i (\phi(\mathbf{x}_i)^T  \phi(\mathbf{x}))\right) $$

$$ \phi(\mathbf{x}_i)^T \phi( \mathbf{x}_j) \longrightarrow k(\mathbf{x}_i,  \mathbf{x}_j) $$

k positive definite, symmetric $\Rightarrow$ there exists a $\phi$! (possilby $\infty$-dim)


???

The idea of this rewrite is that now I observed that the
optimization problem and the prediction problem can be
written only in terms of these inner products. Let's say I
want to use the feature function  ∅, like doing a polynomial
expansion with the polynomial feature transformation and
while if I use ∅x_i as these inputs then they just replace
the x and then I just need the inner products between these
feature vectors, but the only thing I really ever need is
these inner products. Instead of trying to come up with some
feature functions that are good to separate the data points,
I can try it to come up with inner products. I can try to
engineer this thing here instead of trying to engineer the
features. If you write down any positive definite quadratic
form that is symmetric, there's always a ∅. So whenever I
write down any function that is positive definite and
symmetric into vectors, there's always a feature function ∅
so that this is the inner product in this feature space,
which is kind of interesting. The feature space might be
infinite dimensional though. So the idea that it might be
much easier to come up with these kinds of inner products
than trying to find ∅. So we're now trying to design the k,
which makes this whole thing a good nonlinear classifier. So
in this case, obviously, the kernel.

# Examples of Kernels


$$k_\text{linear}(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{x}') = \mathbf{x}^T\mathbf{x}'$$

$$k_\text{poly}(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{x}') = (\mathbf{x}^T\mathbf{x}' + c) ^ d$$

$$k_\text{rbf}(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{x}') = \exp(\gamma||\mathbf{x} -\mathbf{x}'||^2)$$

$$k_\text{sigmoid}(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{x}') = \tanh\left(\gamma \mathbf{x}^T\mathbf{x}'  + r\right)$$

`$$k_\cap(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{x}')= \sum_{i=1}^p \min(x_i, x'_i)$$`

- If $k$ and $k'$ are kernels, so are `$k + k', kk', ck', ...$`

???
There's a couple of kernels that are commonly used. So the
linear kernel just means I just use the inner product in the
original space. That is just the original linear SVM. Other
kernels that are commonly used are like the polynomial
kernel, in which I take the inner products, I add some
constant c and I raise it to power d. There's the RVF
kernel, which is probably the most commonly used kernel,
which is just a Gaussian function above the curve around the
distance of the two data points. There's a sigmoid kernel.
There's the intersection kernel, which computes the minimum.
And if you have any kernel, you can create a new kernel by
adding two kernels together or multiplying them or
multiplying them by constant. The only requirement we have
is that they're positive, indefinite and symmetric.


What does this look like in practice? So, for example, let's
look at this polynomial kernel. It's not very commonly used,
but I think it's one of the ones that are relatively easy to
understand. So the idea of the polynomial kernel is it does
the same thing as computing polynomials. But if you compute
polynomials of a very high degree, your feature vector
becomes very long. Whereas here, I always just need to
compute this inner product and raise them to this power.

# Polynomial Kernel vs Features


$$ k_\text{poly}(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{x}') = (\mathbf{x}^T\mathbf{x}' + c) ^ d $$

Primal vs Dual Optimization<br /><br />

Explicit polynomials $\rightarrow$ compute on `n_samples * n_features ** d`

Kernel trick $\rightarrow$ compute on kernel matrix of shape `n_samples * n_samples`
<br /><br />
For a single feature:

$$ (x^2, \sqrt{2}x, 1)^T (x'^2, \sqrt{2}x', 1) = x^2x'^2 + 2xx' + 1 = (xx' + 1)^2 $$

???
So if I compute explicit polynomials, if I end features and
then I do all the interactions, my data set becomes number
of samples times number of features to the power D. So if I
have 1000 features, and I take D to be 5, this will be
enormous. If I'm using the kernel trick, which is replacing
this inner product in the feature space by the kernel, then
I only need to compute the inner product on the training
data. So I only need to compute on this inner product matrix
which is number of samples times number of samples. So this
is much smaller if number of features to the D is smaller
than number of samples then I can compute, essentially the
same result on something that’s a different representation
of the data. You can see that they're not entirely
equivalent. So doing the polynomial expansion is not
entirely equivalent to the polynomial features but it's
about the same. You can see this quite easily for a single
feature. If I do this for many features, adding extra
features would make a very long feature vector, but the
thing on the right-hand side always stays the same.

# Poly kernels vs explicit features

.center[
![:scale 70%](images/poly_kernel_features.png)

???
You can see that they're very similar, by just applying them
scikit-learn, either the Kernel SVM or the explicit
polynomial features. Here I have this dataset consisting of
classes orange and blue. These are not linearly separable.
So if I use a linear SVM, it wouldn't work. But I can do a
polynomial transformation to go from two features to five
features. In here I just added degree two features. And then
I can learn linear SVM on top of these expanded features
space. I get a very similar result if I instead of expanding
the features, I use the original dataset. But now instead of
learning linear SVM, I use a SVM with the polynomial kernel
of degree 2, they're not exactly the same because there was
this factor of squared of two that I mentioned, but they're
pretty much the same. Question is if we increase the
capacity of the model and we overfit and we'll talk about
this in a little bit, but so, for now, we want to increase
the capacity of a model making more flexible I mean, we
definitely don't want to increase it infinitely. But we
really making out model more flexible. So here for the
polynomial kernel, you could get the same result just by
expanding. If you have a very high degree polynomial it
would be a large expansion. If you use one of the other
kernels, for example, the RVF kernel doing this expansion
would actually be resolved in infinite dimensional vector,
so you couldn't actually do this with a feature vector. Now
I'm looking at this model here on the right-hand side where
I'm using the polynomial features.

# Understanding Dual Coefficients

array([[0.139, 0.06, -0.201, 0.048, 0.019]])

$$ y = \text{sign}(0.139 x_0 + 0.06 x_1 - 0.201 x_0^2 + 0.048 x_0 x_1 + 0.019 x_1^2) $$

```python
linear_svm.dual_coef_

`$$ y = \text{sign}(-0.03 \phi(\mathbf{x}_1)^T \phi(x) - 0.003 \phi(\mathbf{x}_{26})^T \phi(\mathbf{x})  +0.003 \phi(\mathbf{x}_{42})^T \phi(\mathbf{x}) + 0.03 \phi(\mathbf{x}_{62})^T \phi(\mathbf{x})) $$`
]

???
FIXME formula goes over
And so if I look at the linear SVM and I have five
coefficients corresponding to the five features. And so if I
make a prediction, its first coefficient times the first
feature, second coefficient times the second feature and so
on, and I look at the sine of it. This is just a linear
prediction if I want to look what this looks like in terms
of dual coefficients, I can look at the dual coefficients of
linear SVM and the support. Out of these many data points,
there's four, they were selected as support vectors by the
optimization. These are the ones that have these black
circles around them. And so the solution can be expressed as
a linear combination of these four support vectors where the
coefficients are dual coefficients.

If I want to express this in terms of dual coefficients, I
can say its dual coefficient -0.03 times the inner product
of the first data point and my test data point in feature
space. I do the same thing for the train each point 26 and
42 and 63 with their respective weights. Now I can look at
how does this look like for kernel.

---
# With Kernel
`$$y = \text{sign}\left(\sum_i^{n}\alpha_i k(\mathbf{x}_i,  \mathbf{x})\right) $$`

```python
poly_svm.dual_coef_
# array([[-0.057, -0. , -0.012, 0.008, 0.062]])
poly_svm.support_
# array([1,26,41,42,62], dtype=int32)
```
`$$ y = \text{sign}(-0.057 (\mathbf{x}_1^T\mathbf{x} + 1)^2
         -0.012 (\mathbf{x}_{41}^T \mathbf{x} + 1)^2 \\
         +0.008 (\mathbf{x}_{42}^T \mathbf{x} + 1)^2 + 0.062 * (\mathbf{x}_{62}, \mathbf{x} + 1)^2)
$$`

???
So for kernel, the prediction is this. For kernel SVM there
are no coefficients in the original space, there's only dual
coefficients. For each of support vectors, I compute the
kernel of support vector with the test point for which I
want to make a prediction. This is basically the prediction
function of the kernel support vector machine. And you can
see it's very similar to this only that I’ve replaced these
inner products by the kernels. The original idea behind this
kernel trick was to make computation faster. In some cases,
it might be faster.

$$ y = sign(-0.03 * np.inner(poly(X[1]), poly(x)) – 0.003 *
np.inner(poly(X[26]), poly(x)) +0.003 *
np.inner(poly(X[42]), poly(x)) + 0.03 *
np.inner(poly(X[63]), poly(x)) $$

# Runtime Considerations

.center[
![:scale 85%](images/svm_runtime.png)
]

???
So how does it look like in terms of runtime, here I have
the same plot in linear space and log-log space. This is for
a fixed number of features, more features make the kernel
better. But if I fix the number of features, you can see
which of the two is faster. Log-log space is better for
this. So you can see that if I have a very small number of
samples, then linear kernel and doing explicit polynomials
is slower than doing the kernel because of the matrix that's
number of samples times the number of samples is very small.
But if I have a lot of features, then doing the explicit
expansion is faster since the number of samples is large. In
the case where we can do explicit feature expansion if we
have a lot of samples, maybe that's faster.

# Kernels in Practice

- Dual coefficients less interpretable
- Long runtime for “large” datasets (100k samples)
- Real power in infinite-dimensional spaces: rbf!
- Rbf is “universal kernel” - can learn (aka overfit)
anything.

???
So what does this mean for us in practice? One issue is that
the dual coefficients are usually less interpretable because
they give you like weightings of inner products with the
training data points which is maybe less intuitive than
looking at like five times x squared and if you have large
data sets they can become very slow. The real power of
kernels is when the feature space would actually be
infinite-dimensional. The RBF kernel is called the universal
kernel, which means you can learn any possible concept or
you can overfit any possible concept. Same is true for like
neural networks and trees and nearest neighbors, for
example, they can learn anything but linear models and even
polynomial models of a fixed degree cannot learn everything.

#Preprocessing

- Kernel use inner products or distances.
- StandardScaler or MinMaxScaler ftw
- Gamma parameter in RBF directly relates to scaling
of data and n_features – new default is `1/(X.std() * n_features)` but should be `1/X.var() * n_features)` 😞

???
Nearly all of these kernels use the distance in the original
space. These inner products are distances and so scaling is
really important. People use a center scale or min-max
scalar.

For the RBF kernel or for any of the kernels really the
default parameters work well for scale data. If you don't
scale your data default parameters will not work at all. If
you multiply that by five then the default parameters will
give you terrible results.

---

# Parameters for RBF Kernels

- Regularization parameter C is limit on alphas
(for any kernel)
- Gamma is bandwidth: $k_\text{rbf}(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{x}') = \exp(\gamma||\mathbf{x} -\mathbf{x}'||^2)$


.center[
![:scale 85%](images/svm_gamma.png)
]

???
Support vector machine with RBF kernel has these two
parameters you need to tune. These both control complexity
in some way. We already said that the C parameter limits the
influence of each individual data point and the other one is
to kernel bandwidth gamma. A smaller gamma means a wider
kernel. So wider kernel means a simpler model because the
decision boundary will be smoother. Whereas a larger gamma
means a much narrower kernel and that means each data point
will have much more local influence, which means it's more
like the nearest neighbor algorithm and has more complexity.
Usually, you should tune both of these parameters to get a
good tradeoff between fitting and generalization.

---

.center[
![:scale 85%](images/svm_c_gamma.png)
]

???
This plot tries to illustrate these two parameters in the
RBF SVM kernel. On the vertical is C and on the horizontal
is gamma and support vectors are marked with circles. So the
simplest model is basically the one with the smallest gamma
and smallest C. Basically, all data points are support
vectors, everything gets averaged and have a very broad
kernel. Now, if I increase C, I overfit the data more, each
data point can have more influence. And so only the data
points that are really close to the boundary have influence
now. If you increase gamma, the area of influence of each
data point sort of shrinks. So here from it being basically
linear or having this very little curvature if you increase
gamma, it gets more and more curvature. And in the end, if
you make gamma very large, each data point basically has a
small sort of isolated island of its class around it giving
a very complicated decision boundary. So here, for example,
these clearly overfit the training data and so this is
probably too large gamma. There's sort of a tradeoff between
the two. Usually, they're multiple combinations of C and
gamma that will give you similarly good results.

# Scaling and Default Params

.smaller[
```
gamma : float, optional (default = "auto")
  Kernel coefficient for 'rbf', 'poly' and 'sigmoid'.
  If gamma is 'auto' then 1/n_features will be used

scaled_svc = make_pipeline(StandardScaler(), SVC())
print(np.mean(cross_val_score(SVC(), X_train, y_train, cv=10)))
print(np.mean(cross_val_score(scaled_svc, X_train, y_train, cv=10)))

print(np.mean(cross_val_score(SVC(gamma=gamma), X_train, y_train, cv=10)))
```
```
0.987
```
]

???
Gamma by default in scikit-learn is one over the number of
features. This really makes sense only if you scale the data
to have a standard deviation of one, then this is a pretty
good default. Here if I compare cross-validation, kernel SVM
with default parameters on this dataset versus kernel SVM
with the scaled data, the performance is either 57% or 97%.
There's a giant jump between the scaled data and the upscale
data. Actually here in this data set, all the pixels are on
the same scale more or less, so they all are between 0 and
16. So if we change the gamma to be to take into account the
standard deviation of the data set, I actually get pretty
good results. This is actually just a very peculiar dataset
because I basically I know the scale should be from zero to
one when it's from 0 to 16. So scaling by the overall
standard deviation gives me good results here. But in
principle day, I want to convey is that gamma scales with
the standard deviation of the features. Usually, each of the
features has a different standard deviation or a different
scale and so you want to use a centered scale to estimate
the scale for each feature and bring it to one. And then the
default gamma, which is one over number of features will be
sort of reasonable.

# Grid-Searching Parameters

```python
param_grid = {'svc__C': np.logspace(-3, 2, 6),
              'svc__gamma': np.logspace(-3, 2, 6) / X_train.shape[0]}

{'svc_C': array([   0.001,    0.01 ,    0.1  ,    1.   ,   10.   ,  100.   ]),
 'svc_gamma': array([ 0.000001,  0.000007,  0.000074,  0.000742,  0.007424,  0.074239])}
```python
grid = GridSearchCV(scaled_svc, param_grid=param_grid, cv=10)
grid.fit(X_train, y_train)
```
???
To tune them, I use the scaled SVM and both C and gamma
usually learn auto log space, so here I have a log space for
C and gamma. I actually divide this by the number of
features, I could also just change the range, but as I said,
this is sort of something that scales with the number of
features and standard deviation. Then I can just do my
standard grid searchCV with the two-dimensional parameter
grid.

---
# Grid-Searching Parameters

.center[
![:scale 95%](images/svm_c_gamma_heatmap.png)
]

???
Usually, there's a strong interaction between these two
parameters. And the SVM is pretty sensitive to the setting
of these two parameters. So you can see here if you look at
the scales, balance 10 classification dataset. So chance
performance is 10% accuracy. And so if I set the parameters
wrong, I get chance accuracy. If I set them right, I get the
high 90s. So that's the difference between setting gamma to
0.007 and  0.000007 or between setting c to 1 and c to
0.0001.

So usually they're some correlation between the C and gamma
values which are good. So you can decrease or increase C if
you decrease gamma and the other way around.

So usually I like to look at grid search results as a 2d
heat map for this and if your optimum is somewhere on the
boundary, you want to extend your search space. For example,
you can see that I wouldn't need to search this very small
Cs, they don't work at all, but maybe something better might
be over here. A C of 100 is already like a very big C so if
I want to use even less regularization, learning the model
will be even slower.
