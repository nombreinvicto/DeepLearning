From each of the three features, the model can learn the relationship between the target value and whether or not a given passenger embarked at that port.

In binary classification, the class that has more samples is called the \"majority class\", and the class that has fewer samples is called the \"minority class\".\n",

The good news is that we can use any technique I've covered in the course, such as hyperparameter tuning, feature selection, trying non-linear models, and so on. All of those techniques have the potential to improve the model's AUC.\n",

    "The insight behind cost-sensitive learning is that not all prediction errors have the same cost. This can refer to an actual dollar cost of one type of error versus another, or in our case, the real-world implications of a certain type of error.\n",
    "\n",
    "When there's severe class imbalance, it's usually the case that False Negatives, in which positive samples are identified as negative, have a higher cost than False Positives, in which negative samples are identified as positive. This makes sense because the positive samples are rare occurrences, and thus we're more interested in locating the positive samples than the negative samples. In simple terms, we would prefer a False Positive to a False Negative.\n",

Using the default threshold of 0.5, the model achieved a True Positive Rate of 88% and a False Positive Rate of 11%, which is roughly this point on the curve. If we want to move somewhere else on this curve, in order to better match our priorities, we simply change the threshold."

   ]
  },
  {
   "metadata": {},
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "source": [
    "One alternative to ROC curves that you might have heard about is the precision-recall curve. In this lesson, I'll explain the precision-recall curve and then compare it to the ROC curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "To start, I want to look at the confusion matrix for our best model from earlier in the chapter. I'm going to fit the model on X_train and y_train, and then generate class predictions and predicted probabilities for X_test.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, we can create the confusion matrix by comparing the true values with the predicted values. There are two rates that we'll calculate from the confusion matrix this time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first rate is recall, which is just another name for True Positive Rate. It answers the question: When cancer is present, how often is that correctly predicted? We divide the True Positives by the entire bottom row, and we get 95%.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second rate we'll calculate is called precision. It answers the question: When cancer is predicted, how often is that prediction correct? We divide the True Positives by the entire right column, and we get 9%. Notice that unlike all of our other calculations, the denominator for precision is a column total rather than a row total.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both precision and recall are listed in the classification report. We just calculated the precision and recall for class 1, as you can see here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we understand precision and recall, let's plot the precision-recall curve using the plot_precision_recall_curve function, which was introduced in version 0.22. It uses a similar API to plot_roc_curve in that we pass it the fitted model, X_test, and y_test, though the API will be changing in scikit-learn 1.0.\n",
    "\n",
    "So what are we looking at? The precision-recall curve is a plot of precision (on the y-axis) versus recall (on the x-axis) for all possible decision thresholds. This is very similar to an ROC curve in that it can help you to tune the decision threshold of your model based on your priorities.\n",
    "\n",
    "And just like you can summarize an ROC curve by calculating the area underneath it, you can summarize a precision-recall curve by calculating the area underneath it. There are multiple ways to do this calculation, but the metric used in scikit-learn is called average precision.\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate average precision, we import it and pass the true values and the predicted probabilities, and it outputs an average precision of 0.55.\n",
    "\n",
    "To put this in context, a perfect model would achieve a score of 1.0, whereas a completely uninformed model would achieve a score equivalent to the fraction of positive samples, which in this case is about 0.02.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a reminder, the AUC of an uninformed model is 0.5, which means that AUC and average precision usually have very different baseline scores for the same problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, I recommended using AUC as your primary evaluation metric in cases of class imbalance. However, there are many people who recommend using average precision instead. Which metric should you use?\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let me share the most common critique of AUC, and then I'll share my response. Looking at our confusion matrix might be helpful to you during this discussion, so I'll share it now.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's quickly run through the rates again:\n",
    "\n",
    "True Positive Rate (or recall) is 62 out of 65, which is 95%.\n",
    "\n",
    "False Positive Rate is 649 out of 2731, which is 24%.\n",
    "\n",
    "Precision is 62 out of 711, which is 9%.\n",
    "\n",
    "With that in mind, I'll do my best to summarize the most common critique of AUC in cases of class imbalance, which is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "In cases of severe class imbalance, there will be a very large number of True Negatives. As such, the False Positive Rate will be artificially low, and thus the AUC will be artificially high, and so AUC will no longer provide a realistic estimate of the model's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example of this, imagine that we increased the number of True Negatives from 2082 to 200000 but left all the other values the same, as shown here. The False Positive Rate would drop from 24% to 0.3%, and the AUC would increase (though we can't say by how much, since you can't calculate AUC from a confusion matrix). Thus the model would look great based on the AUC, even though the model's precision is still only 9%.\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution, according to this critique, is to use the precision-recall curve and average precision, since it will provide a more realistic estimate of the model's performance by ignoring the number of True Negatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have three responses to this critique.\n",
    "\n",
    "My first response is that neither AUC nor average precision is inherently better, rather it depends on what you're trying to measure:\n",
    "\n",
    "AUC focuses on both classes. In the context of this problem, AUC measures how skillfully the model finds cancer when it's present, balanced against how skillfully the model doesn't find cancer when it's not present.\n",
    "\n",
    "Average precision, on the other hand, focuses only on the positive class. Because both precision and recall ignore the number of True Negatives, the average precision will not change regardless of whether there are two thousand or two million True Negatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, the choice between AUC and average precision is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're interested in a model's performance across both classes, then AUC is the better choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're only interested in how well the model locates the positive class, then average precision is the better choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our particular case of detecting cancer, my judgment is that the performance on both classes is relevant, and thus AUC is the better choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "My second response to this critique is that in cases of severe class imbalance, even if you think the False Positive Rate is artificially low, which makes the model look really good, it's just as fair to call the precision artificially low, which makes the model look really bad.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, I would judge the model shown in this confusion matrix to be excellent:\n",
    "\n",
    "If someone doesn't actually have cancer, they only have a 3 in 1000 chance of being told that they do.\n",
    "\n",
    "And if someone does have cancer, they only have a 5 in 100 chance of being told that they don't.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite these characteristics, the model still has a precision of just 9%. And even if we moved all 3 False Negatives to the True Positive box, resulting in a True Positive Rate of 100%, the precision would still be 9%, making it sound like a very poor model.\n",
    "\n",
    "My third response to this critique is that the actual AUC score is irrelevant, and thus it doesn't matter if the AUC is artificially high.\n",
    "\n",
    "The only reason we're using any evaluation metric during model tuning is that we need some relevant metric to maximize in order to choose between models. AUC fits this purpose well because it measures how skillfully the model is separating the classes. Once you've maximized AUC, then you can change the decision threshold to balance the True Positive Rate and False Positive Rate according to your priorities. But the AUC score itself is never your business objective, so it doesn't matter if the AUC is artificially high.\n",
    "\n",
    "The bottom line is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Both AUC and average precision are reasonable metrics to maximize even in cases of class imbalance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Neither metric is a perfect representation of a model's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Choose AUC if you're interested in the model's performance across both classes, and choose average precision if you're only interested in how well the model locates the positive class."

    "In cases of class imbalance, there is a set of techniques collectively known as \"resampling\" that is often used. Resampling refers to any technique that transforms the training data in order to achieve more balance between the classes. In other words, resampling attempts to fix the class imbalance at the dataset level rather than working around it, which is what we've done in this chapter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the two most common resampling approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "Undersampling (or downsampling) is the process of deleting samples from the majority class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Oversampling (or upsampling) is the process of creating new samples from the minority class, either by duplicating existing samples or by simulating new samples. One popular oversampling method that simulates new samples is SMOTE.\n",

    "Both of these approaches can be done in either a directed, strategic fashion or in a random fashion. Or they can be done together, in which you both undersample and oversample.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regardless of the specific approach, keep in mind that the act of resampling risks deleting important samples and/or adding meaningless new samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of that being said, is resampling actually helpful? Experimental results show that resampling methods can be helpful, but are not always helpful. And while there are dozens of different resampling algorithms, no one algorithm works best across all datasets and models, meaning that it's hard to give practical advice for which one to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you decide to pursue resampling, keep in mind that it's not yet supported by scikit-learn, though it may eventually be available. In the meantime, you can use the imbalanced-learn library, which is supposed to be fully compatible with scikit-learn. Personally, I tend not to use this approach in order to avoid adding additional complexity or project dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are two guidelines for the proper use of resampling:\n",
    "\n",
    "First, you should treat resampling like any other preprocessing technique. Namely, it should be included in a Pipeline in order to avoid data leakage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, the resampling technique should only ever be applied to training data, and not testing data. The model should always be tested on the natural, imbalanced data so that it can output a realistic estimate of model performance."

    "In order to become truly proficient with scikit-learn and go beyond what I've covered in the course, you need to be able to read the documentation. In this lesson, I'm going to walk through the five main pages and page types that you need to be familiar with.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first page is the API Reference, which you can get to by clicking on API from the top navigation bar. The API Reference gives you a high-level view of everything available in scikit-learn. Namely, it lists all of the classes and functions, organized by module.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, this is the compose module. There's a brief description of the module, a link to the relevant section of the User Guide, and descriptions of the two classes and two functions contained in the module. If we wanted to learn more about ColumnTransformer, we could click on it and be taken to the class documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The class documentation is the second type of page you need to be familiar with. It gives you a detailed view of a class, in this case the ColumnTransformer class. At the top is the class signature, which lists the parameters and their default values. Starting in version 0.23, everything after the asterisk needs to be passed as a keyword argument, also known as a named argument, rather than by position. There's also a link to the source code for the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next is the class description, a link to the relevant section of the User Guide, and sometimes the version in which the class was introduced. Next you'll see the same parameters from the class signature, except here it provides a detailed description of each parameter and the expected data type. Below the parameters are the attributes. As a reminder, attributes will end with an underscore if they are learned or estimated from the data during the fit step.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next are links to any related functions or classes, any important notes, and some simple usage examples. The next big section is a list of the methods. It starts with a description of each method, and below that you can see the parameters and return values for each method. Again, you can click on \"source\" to view the source code for any method. Finally, there are links to examples that use this class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's click back to the top of the page, and then click over to the User Guide for ColumnTransformer. The User Guide is the third type of page you need to be familiar with, and you'll know you're in the User Guide when you see the numbered sections. The User Guide is more like a tutorial, because it explains why you might want to use a particular class and advice for how to use that class properly. It often discusses related functions and classes, and includes additional usage examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's go back to the class documentation for ColumnTransformer, click to the bottom, and click on an example. Examples are the fourth type of page you need to be familiar with. Examples vary in structure and length, but their distinguishing feature is that they demonstrate how to solve a particular problem from start to finish. You'll always see imports at the top, and buttons at the bottom to run the example online or download the example to your computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's go back to the class documentation for ColumnTransformer one more time, click up to the top, then scroll to parameters. Sometimes in the documentation, you'll see highlighted terms that are not classes or functions, such as fit and transform in this case. If you click on it, you'll be taken to the Glossary, which is the fifth page you need to be familiar with. The Glossary defines almost all of the important terms used in the scikit-learn documentation. If you just want to browse through it, you can access it through the More menu in the top navigation bar.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let me now summarize the five pages and page types we walked through, and describe how I use them.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first page is the API reference. I go here when I want to see what classes or functions are in a particular module. For example, if I wanted to review all of the classes and functions that are available for preprocessing, the API reference is the fastest way to do this.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second page type is the class documentation. I go here any time I need to understand a particular class in-depth, especially all of its parameters and attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The third page type is the User Guide. I go here when I need more context about a particular class or function, or advice about how to use it properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fourth page type is Examples. I go here when I need to see a more complex usage example of a particular class, since the examples in the class documentation and User Guide are purposefully simple.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fifth page is the Glossary. I go here when I need to understand a particular term and it's not covered in the User Guide.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're ever unsure where to start, you can click on User Guide in the top navigation bar and just start browsing the section that seems most relevant, or you can do a search in the search box."
