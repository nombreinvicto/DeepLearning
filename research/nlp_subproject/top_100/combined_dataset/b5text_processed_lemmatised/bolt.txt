distinct bolt screw commonli misunderstood
sever practic differences, degre overlap bolt screw
defin distinction, per machinery' handbook, intend purpose: bolt assembl two unthread components, aid nut
screw contrast use compon contain thread, screw may even cut intern thread
mani thread fasten describ either screw bolts, depend use
bolt often use make bolt joint
combin nut appli axial clamp forc also shank bolt act dowel, pin joint sideway shear forc
reason, mani bolt plain unthread shank (call grip length) make better, stronger dowel
presenc unthread shank often given characterist bolt vs
screws,but incident use, rather defin
unthread grip length chosen carefully, around length thick materi washer bolt pass
overli long unthread length prevent nut tighten correctli
insuffici unthread length result thread extend hole, place dowel shear load onto threads, may caus fret wear hole
