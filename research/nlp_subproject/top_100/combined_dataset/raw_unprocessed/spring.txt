Found in clothespins, spring clamps, and mousetraps, torsion springs wrap around a shaft or rod to maintain pressure on objects as they rotate.

Torsion springs should be used in the direction in which the coils are wound. Left-hand wound springs wind clockwise toward you.Right-hand wound springs wind counterclockwise toward you.

Deflection angle represents the angle between the legs as well as the maximum spring rotation. All springs rotate until their legs are parallel. For example, a spring with a 90° deflection angle will rotate a maximum of 90°. Maximum torque is the torque required to rotate the spring legs to the parallel position.

Rotating a torsion spring tightens the spring around a shaft and increases the spring length. Using a shaft with a larger diameter than the values listed for maximum shaft diameter will interfere with the spring’s motion.

Multiple rows of waves allow these springs to handle higher loads than other similarly sized wave disc springs.

Springs with flat ends have a single, flat contact surface to distribute force evenly on adjacent components.

A spring is a device that changes its shape in response to an external force, returning to its original shape when the force is removed. The energy expended in deforming the spring is stored in it and can be recovered when the spring returns to its original shape. Generally, the amount of the shape change is directly related to the amount of force exerted. If too large a force is applied, however, the spring will permanently deform and never return to its original shape.
