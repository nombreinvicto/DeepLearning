# Beyond Bags of Words

Limitations of bag of words:
- Semantics of words not captured
- Synonymous words not represented
- Very distributed representation of documents
???
One possible reason to do this is that you want to get a
representation of your text data that's more semantic.

In bag of words, the semantics of the words are not really
captured at all. Synonymous words are not represented, if
you use a synonym it will be like a completely different
feature and will have nothing to do with another feature.
The representation is very distributed, you have hundreds of
thousands of features and it's kind of hard to reason about
such a long vector sometimes, in particular, if you have
longer documents.

Today, we're going to talk about classical unsupervised
methods. And next time, we're going to talk about word
vectors and word embedding, which also tries to solve the
same problem of getting more semantically meaningful
representations for text data.

# Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA)

- Reduce dimensionality of data.
- Can't use PCA: can't subtract the mean (sparse data)
- Instead of PCA: Just do SVD, truncate.
- "Semantic" features, dense representation.
- Easy to compute - convex optimization
???
LSA is basically just the same as PCA. The idea is to reduce
the dimensionality of the data to some semantically
meaningful components. The thing is, we can't easily do PCA
here, because we can’t remove the mean. Remember, this is a
sparse dataset and so the zero is sort of meaningful and if
we shift the zero, like by trying to subtract the mean, we
will get a density dataset that won't have many zeros
anymore and so we won’t be able to even store it.

There are ways to still compute PCA without explicitly creating
a big dense matrix, but in the traditional LSA, we just
ignore that and do a singular value decomposition of the data.
This is exactly the
same computation as PCA, only, we don't subtract the mean.

This is very easy to compute. You can do the SVD very
easily. And there's a unique solution that you can compute.
And then you have something that's like a dense
representation of the data and hopefully, it's semantic in
some way.

As with all unsupervised methods, this can be hit or miss a
little bit.

# LSA with Truncated SVD

.smaller[
```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer
vect = CountVectorizer(stop_words="english", min_df=4)
X_train = vect.fit_transform(text_train)
X_train.shape
```
```
(25000, 30462)
```
```python
from sklearn.decomposition import TruncatedSVD
lsa = TruncatedSVD(n_components=100)
X_lsa = lsa.fit_transform(X_train)
lsa.components_.shape
```
```
(100, 30462)
```
]
???
So the way to do this with scikit-learn is with truncated
SVD. Truncated SVD is basically the implementation of PCA
that doesn't subtract the mean. We didn't call it LSA,
because if you do this in the context of text processing,
you can do this whenever you have a sparse dataset, you
would want to do something like PCA but it's sparse, then
you can use the truncated SVD.

Here, I'm just using the training set, 25,000 documents, I
removed the stop words, and I set min_df=4.

So basically, I removed the most common words, which are
stop words, and I removed the very infrequent words. So I
have a more reasonably sized vocabulary. And then I did a
truncated SVD and extract 100 components. And so the
components I extracted, are 100 X number of features. So I
have 100 vectors, where each feature corresponds to one of
the words in the vocabulary.

.smaller[
```python
plt.semilogy(lsa.explained_variance_ratio_)
```
]

.center[
![:scale 70%](images/lsa_truncated_svd_plot.png)
]
???
As we saw with PCA, we can look at the explained variance
ratio.

Here's is a semi-log scale. And you can see that the first
one or two explain a lot and then rapidly decreases. A lot
is captured in the first 10, and then it goes down.

But still at 100, there's still a lot of variances left, so
it'll just probably go down logarithmically as it goes on.
We can also look at the eigenvectors with the highest
singular values.

---
# First Six eigenvectors

.center[
![:scale 100%](images/lsa_six_eigvec.png)
]

???
Here are the 6 first eigenvectors. I'm showing only the
entries that have the largest magnitude, either positive or
negative.

I'm showing the 10 largest magnitudes entries of each of the
eigenvectors. So again, keep in mind that the sign doesn't
really mean anything, since its eigenvalues, but sort of the
relative sign means something.

So the first one is sort of what you would usually get.
They're all positive because all entries in the data matrix
are positive since its bag of words. This is sort of, in a
sense, just translating into the middle of the data,
somewhat similar to trying to model the mean. ‘Movie’ and
‘film’ are obviously the most common words.

The second eigenvector is whether someone uses the word
‘movies’ or ‘films’. You can see that either someone uses
‘film’ and ‘films’ or ‘movie’ and ‘movies’. Basically,
people don't usually use both of them in the same comment.
It is just interesting that this is the one of the largest
components of variances, whether a person uses this one word
or this other word that is completely synonymous.



Points in direction of mean

# Scale before LSA

```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import MaxAbsScaler
scaler = MaxAbsScaler()
X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)

lsa_scaled = TruncatedSVD(n_components=100)
X_lsa_scaled = lsa_scaled.fit_transform(X_scaled)
```

???
There are 2 things that you can do, you can normalize for
the length of the document, or you can scale so that all the
features are on the same scale.

MaxAbsScaler performs the same way as a standard scaler,
only it doesn't subtract the mean. So it just scales
everything to have the same maximum absolute value. And so
in this sense, I'm basically scaling down film and movie to
have the same importance as the
other words. I can also normalize and get rid of the length
of the document. But I don't think it actually had an effect
here. And then I can compute the same thing.


- "Movie" and "Film" were dominating first couple of components. Try to get rid of that effect.

---

# Eigenvectors after scaling

.center[
![:scale 100%](images/lsa_six_eigvec_scaled.png)
]
???
This is the first six eigenvectors of LSA after scaling. The
first one still points towards the direction of the mean. So
I found some components like the third one here, which are
interesting because I interpreted this as like a writer
sophistication. So there are some people that use a lot of
very short words and some people use a lot of very long
words. So people that use words like ‘cinematography’ also
use words like ‘performance’ and ‘excellent’. This also
comes out from some of the other methods.

And so I looked at a couple of these components and it
turned out that the component 1 and the component 3 are
actually related to the good and bad review.



- Movie and film still important, but not that dominant any more.

# Some Components Capture Sentiment

```python
plt.scatter(X_lsa_scaled[:, 1], X_lsa_scaled[:, 3], alpha=.1, c=y_train)

0.827
```
```python
lr_lsa.score(X_lsa_scaled[:, :10], y_train)
```
```
0.827
```
]
???
This scatter plot is positive reviews versus negative
reviews. Some of the components actually capture the
semantic attributes we are interested in.

It was completely unsupervised, we didn't put that in and
this is just a bunch of movie reviews. But these two
components, actually, seem to be pretty related to the
sentiment of the comment writer.

I also run a logistic regression on 10 components and it was
at 83% accuracy.

I thought that was actually pretty good. It was 88% using
the bag of word representation. So you got 88% if you used
30,000 dimensions, and you get 83% if you used 10
dimensions. So it is completely unsupervised compression of
the data. So it's not as good as the original data set but
if you take 100 components you recover the same accuracy.

So these components definitely capture something that’s
semantic, and it allows us to classify even if we use lower
dimensional representation.


- Not competitive but reasonable with just 10 components

# Topic Models
???
Next, I want to talk a little bit about models that are
somewhat more specific to the text data, or that allows us
maybe to interpret the text data a little bit more clearly.

The idea of topic models is basically that each document is
created as a mixture of topics. Each topic is a distribution
over words. And we want to learn the topics that are
relevant to our corpus and which of these topics contribute
to each individual document.

Topics could be the genre of movie, or the sentiment, or the
comment writer sophistication, or whether English is their
native language or so on. And so each of them is would be
topics. So the topic is not necessarily sorted of semantic
topic, but something that influences the choice of
vocabulary for a given document.

For each document, you assume that several of these topics
are active and others are not and they have very varying
importance. So movies could be mixtures of different genres
and then they could have words from multiple genres.

---

# Motivation

- Each document is created as a mixture of topics
- Topics are distributions over words
- Learn topics and composition of documents simultaneously
- Unsupervised (and possibly ill-defined)
???
This is an unsupervised task, so it’s probably ill-defined
and so results are open to interpretation, and also depend
on how exactly you formulate the task.
---

# NMF for topic models

.center[
![:scale 80%](images/nmf.png)
]
???
The first model I want to use for this is NMF.

In NMF, remember, we have a data matrix, X, which is now our
large sparse matrix of word counts and we factorize this
into HxW, H is the hidden or latent representation, and W
represents the weights.


---
# NMF objectives
# NMF Loss and algorithm

Frobenius loss / squared loss ($ Y = H W$):

`$$\large l_{\text{frob}}(X, Y) = ||X - Y||_{\mathrm{Fro}}^2 = \sum_{i,j} (X_{ij} - Y_{ij})^ 2$$`

Kulback-Leibler (KL) divergence:
`$$\large l_{\text{KL}}(X, Y) = \sum_{i,j} X_{ij} \log\left(\frac{X_{ij}}{Y_{ij}}\right) - X_{ij}  + Y_{ij}$$`

???
There are 2 possible objectives NMF can minimize, you pick one of the two.

You want X to be close to HxW, that’s the whole goal. There
are 2 common ways in which people measure this.

The first one at the top is called x norm, it's just least
squares basically. So you look at the least squares
difference element-wise between the entries in the X and the
entries in the product, 〖HW〗_ij. This one is the mostly
common used one and also the default in scikit-learn.

The bottom one is the one which was originally proposed,
which is basically, a version of the KDE, which is usually a
measure that finds similarities between distributions. But
here, it's applied basically to element-wise entries of this
matrix. The authors use that because then they could drive
nice ways to minimize this.

Minimizing either of these is not convex but if you hold one
of the two fixes, then minimizing the other one is convex.
So you usually iterate doing either gradient descent or
coordinate descent on H and then doing it on W, then you're
iterate between the two.
---

# NMF for topic models

.center[
![:scale 95%](images/nmf_1.png)
]
???
When applying this to text, the rows of X, corresponds to
movie reviews, the columns of X correspond to words. So that
means the rows of H, correspond to documents, and the
columns of H correspond to the importance of a given topic
for a given document. The rows in W corresponds to topics,
one row in W is lengths of vocabulary that states the words
that are important for a particular topic. So you might have
a component with like horror, scary, monster and so on.

If the first topic is about horror movies, and the first
movie is a horror movie, then it would be a large first
component. Since everything is positive, and so the additive
components are added together. That possibly makes it a
little bit more interpretable.


- Each row of W corresponds to one "topic"

# NMF on Scaled Data

.smallest[
```python
nmf_scale = NMF(n_components=100, verbose=10, tol=0.01)

]

.center[
![:scale 65%](images/nmf_scaled_plot.png)
]
???
Sorted by "most active" components
???
NMF, as I said, is an iterative optimization so this runs
way longer than the LSA.

Q: What’s the variable ’tol’ do?
A: It’s stopping tolerance.

These are subsets of the columns of W. I’m visualizing the
rows of W and I'm only looking at the ones that have large
absolute values. So the Y values are the weight that this
word has inside this topic. So the word ‘really’ has the
weight of 7 in this first topic.

So obviously, they have entries for all words, but I didn't
put in a penalty so that they're sparse. So they'll have
non-zero entries for all words, but sort of the interesting
ones are the big ones.

The way that I picked these 9 components here out of the 100
components was the ones that have the highest activation in
X. I, then realize it might not be the most interesting
thing. Might be more interesting to look at the ones that
are less peaked.

If you look at more components, you'll find other
genre-specific components.

One of the things you can do with this is you can find
genre specific reviews by looking at the component that
corresponds to it.

# NMF with tfidf

![:scale 70%](images/nmf_topics_tfidf.png)
???
You can also run this on TF-IDF. Again, results are somewhat
similar to before. The top-ranked components are now
different. It really only makes sense if you look at all 100
components, but it's very hard to do. So I picked out just a
couple.

This was with a 100 components. That said, if you use fewer
components, you get something that is much more general.

---


# NMF with tfidf and 10 components

.center[
![:scale 70%](images/tfidf_10comp_plot.png)
]

???
This is using 9 components. The first one, probably kind of
models the mean and points in the center.

Q: is the task here still to classify between good and bad
reviews?

The application of that I had in the back of my head is I'm
interested in the reviews, good or bad, but this is all
completely unsupervised. So I never put in anything about
these two classes even existing. This is just trying to help
me understand corpus overall.

The main things that I found so far are that it finds things
that are genre specific, some of them are very specific,
like Star Wars and DC comics, some of them are less specific
like horror movies, but then it finds some that are about
sentiments.

The reason why I call these topics is since they are
additive. And so maybe someone would argue that this is not
really a topic model, because it's not technically a topic
perfect model but it does exactly the same as a topic model
does. It does a positive decomposition. I think that's
easier to interpret in this context. Because what does it
mean for a document to be not about horror movies.

Less number of components will give you more generic things.
If you use more number of components, there might be generic
components. If you want to force them to be generic, you can
use fewer components. Using fewer components definitely
makes it easy to look at them.

A friend of mine who is an expert on topic models told me to
always use thousands of components, and then go through all
of them and see if something's interesting.

#Latent Dirichlet Allocation
# (the other LDA)
(Not Linear Discriminant Analysis)
???
Next thing I want to talk about is LDA. We are going from
simple models to more complex model.

What people think about if they hear topic model is usually
LDA. Dave Blei in the sets department invented LDA. This is
like an incredibly popular model right now.

---

# The LDA Model

.center[
![:scale 90%](images/lda_model.png)
]
.smallest[
(stolen from Dave and John)
]

???
This a probabilistic generative model. The idea is you write
down a generative process of how each document is created.
This is similar to mixture models where basically, for each
point you want to create, you picked one of the Gaussians
and then you sample from it. That’s how we create points in
this distribution.

Similarly, in the LDA model, let's say, you're given some
topics and these topics have, like word importance. Given
the topics, the way that you generate a document would be,
first, you draw which of these topics are important, and how
important are they?

Each document is a mixture of topics and then for each word,
you decide which of these topics to you want to draw a word
from. And then you draw a word from that topic, according to
the word importance.

This is clearly not really how text is generated but it's
sort of reasonable proxy. This is based on the bag of word
model so it only looks at word counts. It doesn't do that
context at all. You could do it on bigrams, but that's not
what people usually do.

The idea is how likely is it that a word appears in this
document and basically, for each word individually, you pick
a topic, and then you generate a word from this topic and in
the end, you end up with a big bag of word representation.
The idea is that this a generative process, given corpus of
documents, can I actually do inference in this? Can I find
out what were the topics that generated this model? And what
are the topic proportions for each of the documents? And
what are the word assignments?

So basically, you write down this generative process and
then given your documents, you're trying to invert it and
figure out what were the topics.



- Generative probabilistic model (similar to mixture model)
- Bayesian graphical model
- Learning is probabilistic inference
- Non-convex optimization (even harder than mixture models)

You can write down this generative model in flight
notations. I don't think we looked at the plate notation yet
because I don’t find it very helpful.

So this is a depiction of the graphical model where
basically, each of these circles is a variable. And these
red things are called plates and they mean a variable is
duplicated.

So here, there are 2 parameters you specified beforehand,
which are the hyperparameters, Alpha and Beta.

Then there are K topics, I fixed the number of topics and I
call them K. And for each topic, I have a distribution over
words, like how important is each word in each topic. Then D
goes over documents. So for each document, I have a
distribution over the topics that states that a particular
document is so much about this topic, and so much about
another topic.

So for each document, I have a vector that tells me the
topic proportions. Finally, inside the document, for each
word I have a variable, that tells me which topic the word
belongs to and then given the topic, what is the word.

Here, this outer plate is replicated along all the documents
and then inside each document, for each word, there's the
inner plate.

But the only thing that I actually observe is basically the
W, which is the word count. So I observed which words
appeared in these documents. I also set alpha and beta as
some prior parameters usually.

What I want to find out is the topic distribution over words
and the documents specific distributions over topics. So I
want to know what the topics are and what topics are a given
document about.

This is very similar to the thing that we had in NMF.

The flight notation graph can be read as
A) The generative process or
B) Dependency structure in the probability distribution.

So basically, the distribution that you can easily think of
is like, what should the work distribution be? And so the
word, I choose it from a discreet of distribution, like
given a particular topic, I take the distribution of words
in this topic and I pick from that distribution.

So this is a categorical distribution where you say, under
this distribution, each word is so and so likely. So this
multinomial distribution, this is how I pick a word given a
topic.

But the distribution in this is Dirichlet data
distributions.

Basically, you want the distribution over distribution, you
want the distribution where the outcome is multinomial
distribution, and for the W, I want multinomial
distributions and so the pi, the outcome of drawing there,
needs to be multinomial distribution.

The national prior over things that give me multinomial
distributions is called Dirichlet.




- K topics = multinomial distributions over words
- "mixture weights" for each document:
	* How important is each topic for this document
    * Each document contains multiple topics!

## Multinomial
.smaller[It models the probability of counts for rolling a k-sided die n times.]
.quote_author[wikipedia]


$$ P(x_1, \dots, x_k |n, p_1, \dots, p_k) = \frac{n!}{x_1! \dots x_k!} p_1^{x_1} \dots p_k^{x^k}$$

--

## Dirichlet
`$$ P(x_1, \dots, x_k | \alpha_1, \dots \alpha_k)=\frac{1}{B(\alpha)} x_1^{\alpha_1 - 1} \dots x_k^{\alpha_k - 1} $$`




???
- if $p(x|\theta)$ is multimnomial (discrete distribution), <br>then $p(\theta) = \text{Dirichlet}(...)$ is a conjugate prior.

This is how it looks in formula. For multinomial, let’s say
I draw n words from a multinomial. There are k possible
words, I draw n, so I draw the same word multiple times, and
the probability of drawing a particular word is P1 to Pk. So
then the probability of a specific draw is P1 to X1, and so
on from Pk to the Xk and then normalized.

Dirichlet is basically the same, only the other way around.
You can see that here, the Ps in multicultural distribution
become the Xs in Dirichlet distribution. Dirichlet looks
exactly the same. Only now, you have a distribution over
these base probabilities.

That makes it very easy to include the data into the prior
information and compute the posterior.
---

# Conjugate Prior

- Prior is called "conjugate" of the posterior has the same form as prior
$$ P(\theta | x) = \frac{p(x | \theta)p(\theta)}{\int_{}^{} p(x | \theta^\prime)p(\theta^\prime)d\theta^\prime} $$
???
The reason why we’re using generative prior is because of
the conjugate prior of the multinomial distribution.  Let’s
say we have a prior over our word topic distribution and
then we observe some words belonging to some of the topics,
we have some evidence that these words are drawn from these
topics and then we want to update our word topic prior,
given the information that we saw.

p(x|θ) would be our multinomial distribution, meaning given
the topic, what are the multinomial distribution. And
basically, we want p(θ|x) to be easy to compute. And it's
easiest to compute if we use the conjugate prior here,
because then posterior will have the same distribution as
the prior.

Here are some examples in 3D. Dirichlet distribution is like
a distribution over distributions. So a point drawn from
Dirichlet distribution is a multinomial distribution.

So here, let's say you have a multinomial with 3 variables,
this lives inside the probability simplex in 3-dimensions.
The dark blue sector is sort of the space all 3 numbers that
sum up to one.

And so now you can try put a prior on this. So we want to
distribution over the simplex of all 3 numbers that add up
to 1. And so what we're doing for LDA is usually, we make
this sort of symmetric in all directions because we don't
really have a preference for like, saying one topic is more
important than the other topic, that's not our prior
knowledge, because they are arbitrary.

It’s pretty likely that all the topics are equally
important, that means I have put math only in the very
center or I can say, I didn't really know how important each
of the topics is, and then you can get points at the
corners, which means that each document can be about only a
few topics. If you use this, then each document will be
about many topics.

And similarly, these priors use both on the document topic
distribution, and on the topic word distribution. So
similarly, for each topic, you can have each topic being
very broad.

So the third one means broad, you assign probability mass to
most words.  While the first one means you can assign
probability mass only to a couple of the words.

???
There's basically 2 schools of thought on how we can best
solve this. These are ways to do inference and generalize
the models.

Gibbs sampling is a form of MCMC, so it's like a stochastic
simulation. Basically, you simulate process going on for a
long time, you keep sampling and in the end, you get as a
stationary distribution, the real distribution that you're
interested in.  This is very accurate. You can do this for
any probabilistic model. But it's very slow because you need
to simulate the process of generating the data for a long
until it lines up with what's in the data. Gibbs sampling a
form of sampling so it’s like a very random process.

The other one is variational inference. This is more from an
optimization perspective. This is very similar to the
expectation-maximization algorithm that's used for GMMs,
which is similar to that of the KMeans idea of alternating
between assignment and maximization. This is a deterministic
algorithm, it's quite a bit faster than Gibbs sampling
usually, but less accurate. The way that it does
approximations is not entirely clear. This is used by Dave
Blei all the time.

# Pick a solver

- “Small data” (<= 10k? Documents):
	* Gibbs sampling (lda package, MALLET in Java)
- “Medium data” (<= 1M? Documents):
	* Variational Inference (scikit-learn default)
- “Large Data” (>1M? Documents):
	* Stochastic Variational Inference
	* SVI allows online learning (partial_fit)

- Edward by Dustin Tran: http://edwardlib.org/
  * Tensor-flow based framework for stochastic variational inference.
  * Now Tensorflow Probability: https://www.tensorflow.org/probability

Pick a solver depending on the amount of the documents you
have.

Ida package (Python) and MALLET (Java) works well if you
have very few documents. Otherwise, it gets too slow.

Variational inference or batch variational inference, which
will be the default in scikit-learn in the future. Both are
used on medium sized documents.

For large data, you can do stochastic variation inference,
which is the current default in scikit-learn. But that's
sort of an approximation to the approximation. It's
something like doing stochastic gradient descent on the
optimization variational inference.

Partial_fit can be used on streaming data.

If you’re more serious about this, look at the works of
Dustin Tran. He created Edward, I think it's now
incorporated into TensorFlow. It’s a library for doing
variational inference in all kinds of different graphical
models with GPU acceleration.

Talking about SGD, maybe it's good if have a lot of data,
maybe it's worth doing an approximation that allows you to
use all the data, if the other option is to do something
that’s fairly exact, but you have to subsample your data a
lot, then that might give you worse results than just doing
something that's pretty bad.

SVI is maybe not the greatest optimizer but it allows you to
use large amounts of data, and so in the end to get a better
result.


Variational might be more sensitive to hyper parameters? Or give different results?

Implementing in scikit-learn is pretty straightforward. The
components are not ordered, and changing number of
components changes everything. Here, I do
learning_method=batch and the other one is
learning_method=online, but since the dataset is not that
big, it'll just give me sort of worse results.

Everything is positive because these are now the word topic
matrices. It tells me if I picked this topic, what's the
probability of each of these words and they're actually on a
log scale. They sum up to 1 in a sense. This is using 10
topics, so this is pretty generic.



- Very generic, similar to NMF(n_components=10).
TV Series, “family drama”, and “history / war” topics

Here, I picked out a couple of topics that I thought were
interesting.

One thing that you can do is try to interpret this. You can
use both this and NMF as a representation for
classification, for example. There's no guarantee that it's
a good representation, but it might be a better
representation than the bag of words.

If you do the NMF with 100 components, you actually get a
slightly better result than if you use just a bag of word
vectors. Doing the NMF actually helps you to get some
features that are semantic for the task of classifying good
versus bad reviews.

- $\beta$ (or $\eta$) = topic_word_prior
- Both dirichlet distributions
- Large value $\xrightarrow[]{}$ more dispersed
- Small value $\xrightarrow[]{}$ more concentrated

I want to talk a little bit more about the specifics for
LDA. There are 2 parameters that you need to tune. Both are
Dirichlet priors over distribution, one over the topic
distribution and one over the document topic distribution.

Large value use means that they're more dispersed. Small
values mean they’re more concentrated.

# Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC)

**Goal**: Sample from complex distribution $p(X_1, ... X_n)$.

**Monte Carlo algorithm**: "correct in expectation" / "correct on average"

**Markov Chain**: a sequence of probability distribution, each depending only on the previous state.

**Markov Chain Monte Carlo**: a sequence of probability distributions so that on average you sample from the target distribution.

(The stationary distribution of the Markov chain is the target distribution $p$)

# (Block) Gibbs Sampling for LDA
.center[
![:scale 50%](images/lda_params.png)
]
???
This is sort of the generative process of the data. And so
what Gibbs sampling does is, we observe the words W and we
are given the priors, alpha, and beta, so now we want to
figure out the word topic indicators and the documents
specific distribution over topics and topic distribution
over words.

The way that Gibbs sampling works is it basically assigns
these randomly and then draws the posterior distribution for
each of these variables, given all the other variables.

So if we know all the words and the topic assignments of the
words, then we can look at what's the distribution of the
topics over words likely to be.

If we know alpha, we know all the topic distributions for
each document then we can also compute the document specific
distributions over topics. So basically, if you know all the
information that's connected to give node, you can draw this
given node, given all the other information.

And then you just iterate these.

I'm not sure how to phrase this…given all the other
variables, you can randomly draw one of the variables and
then fix these and randomly draw the other variables. And
this gives you sort of a mark of change, meaning that every
time you draw this, the distribution over the other things
will change. And if you keep drawing and keep drawing, in
the end, you will get to a distribution, which is sort of
the correct posterior. Which just means it's going to be the
most likely assignment of topics, given to documents.

If you do this, if you fix the document specific
distribution over topics and if you fix the topic
distribution over works, then all of the documents become
independent, because everything that you need to know about
one document is already covered in the documents specific
distribution over topics and the other documents don't
really matter.

If you do it this way, you can easily paralyze it over
documents, for example.

Updates sampled from:

`$p(z_{iv} = k \, \vert \, \mathbf{\theta}_i, \phi_k) \propto \exp(\log \theta_{ik} + \log \phi_{k, y_{iv}})$`

`$p(\theta_i \, \vert \, z_{iv} = k, \phi_k) = \text{Dir}(\alpha + \sum_l \mathbb{I}(z_{il} = k))$`

`$p(\phi_k \, \vert \, z_{iv} = k, \mathbf{\theta}_i) = \text{Dir}(\beta + \sum_i \sum_l \mathbb{I}(y_{il} = v, z_{il} = k))$`

???
i is index for documents, v is index for words in document, k index for topics.
z is word-topic assignments.

$z_{iv}=k$ means word v in document i is assigned topic k.

$\theta$ is document topic distribution, $\theta_{ik}$ is the probability of a word in document i to come from topic k.

$y_{iv}$ is the actual word (word-index) of word v in document i.

$\phi_{k, y}$ is the probability of a drawing word y from document k.
$\phi_{k, y_{iv}}$ is the probability

# Collapsed Gibbs Sampling for LDA
.center[
![:scale 50%](images/lda_params.png)
]

Sample only `$p(z_i=k|\mathbf{z}_{-i})$`

Compute $\theta$, $\phi$ from $\mathbf{z}$
???
If you don't want to paralyze it, you can reformulate Gibbs
sampling into collapsed Gibbs sampling, where we only look
at the topic so we can analytically compute away π and theta
and we can look only at z, which is the topic assignments
for each word. And we can only draw the Zs for each word, in
order for each word we draw which topic this word comes
from.

The problem with this is if we integrate this and this (the
smallest and the largest red rectangle) then all of the
different words will be dependent. So we can't do this in
parallel anymore, we have to go word by word and for each
word we draw, what's the probability of this word belonging
to this topic given all the other word assignments.

This makes the math a little bit easier, but it means it's
going to be sequential. Once we computed all these word
topic assignments we can then get the topic distribution
over words and the documents specific distribution over
topics (once we have all the z_is)



Now looking at all documents together (i goes over words and documents).
$z_{-i}$ is word-topic assignments for all other words for all documents.
Now sequential problem!

???
If you want to learn more about this, in particular, about
the practical aspects of this, there are 2 papers that I
really recommend.

Both of these talk more about how to use LDA in practice and
how to tune hyperparameters and so on.

One thing I want to say is that the hyperparameters behave
actually quite different for the variational inference and
the Gibbs sampling. I think the first paper uses Gibbs
sampling, and the second uses inference. Things are very
different between these two approaches, even though you're
trying to optimize the same probabilistic model.
