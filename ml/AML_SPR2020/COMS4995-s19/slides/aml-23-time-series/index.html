# Tasks

???
I want to talk about different tasks that are associated
with time series that you might come across.
---

# 1d Forecasting

.center[![:scale 80%](images/1d forecasting.png)]

???

- 1d time-series forecasting
  - Number of customers (naive)

One of the most common tasks is 1D forecasting. 1D
forecasting means you have a time series, you have the
history of the time series, and you want to predict how this
time series will evolve in the future. There are no
additional features here, only the history of how does 1D
signal evolve.

This example here is of a toy dataset of the CO2
concentration on top of a volcano in Hawaii.

---

# Nd Forecasting

.center[![:scale 80%](images/nd forecasting.png)]

???
- Multivariate time-series -- forecast all
  - Stock market

You can also do ND forecasting where you're simultaneously
trying to forecast multiple times series. Here are 3
different stocks. You might observe the history of these and
determine how they will evolve in the future.

These 3 stocks are simultaneously the featured input that we
learned from and things we want to predict. I don't
recommend trying to predict the stock market, though, that
doesn't work.

# Feature-based forecasting &nbsp; (expanatory variables)

.center[![:scale 80%](images/feature based forecasting.png)]

???
- Multivariate time-series -- forecast one
  - Number of customers (with features)

You can also have feature based forecasting where we have an
additional explanatory variable. For example, this is trying
to predict the energy consumption of a household based on
the weather. Here, you're trying to predict 1D time series,
but you also have not only the series of the past, but you
have the explanatory variables that you can measure. Since
you have a measure of them from the past so you’d know how
much energy the household consumed, what the weather was,
how much was spent on heating and light and something like
that. And also, when you want to make a prediction, you also
know for that point in time what the weather was.

So this more closely resembles the supervisor models that
we’ve seen so far. Here, we have the features and the
targets separated. In the other cases, we didn't really have
features and the target separated, we just had the 1D
series.

---

# Time Series Classification

.center[![:scale 70%](images/time series classification.png)]

???


- Time-series classification (1d or Nd)
  - Activity from smart phone sensors

The other tasks were all sort of regression tasks and you
usually want to predict a continuous variable. In time
series classification, you don't actually want to predict a
time series but given a time series, you want to label the
time series.

Here in this example, this is energy data. We have the
energy signatures of different appliances in a house. So you
see basically the energy consumed by a household and you
want to detect what appliance was turned on and off. You
have a 1D signal, which is how much energy do they consume
and you want to classify this signal to determine which
application was turned on.

Here, the output is a single label labeling a time series.
These are actually quite different tasks but you should be
aware of what you want when you work with a time series, do
you want to predict the time series? Do you want to forecast
the time series? Do you have explanatory variables there? Or
do you want to just label a whole time series?

Depending on what you want to do, there are several
different challenges.

---
class: spacious

# What's different?

- Forecasting: Not iid
- Classification: Not necessarily same length


???
The main difference is that for the first 3 tasks, the data
is not IID. You don't have features and targets and the
targets are independent of each other, given the features,
but you have temporal component and over time, they might be
a trend there or at least, a correlation. So at different
times, the output will be correlated. We need to have
basically completely different tools to work with this.

You could try to make an assumption that given your
explanatory variables, your targets are IID, but it will
probably give you a bad model. And more importantly, if you
do an evaluation, it'll give you too optimistic evaluations.

Usually, in the underlying time series, there’s some drift
in the concepts, things just don't stay constant over time
so when you evaluate, you need to take into account that
things change. Usually, you want to learn from the past and
predict the future. So you need to make sure that you do
this in your evolution.

If you want to do time series classification, we're actually
not going to talk about this today. But the main the
struggle here is getting a feature representation of a time
series. So then this often becomes more of a feature
extraction problem, how can I get a fixed length feature
vector from a time series?

Usually, these time series are not the same length or you
have a continuous series and you want to classify parts of
it, you want to detect an event happening. To make this into
a standard supervised classification problem is a little bit
tricky.

The main thing we're going to talk about today is 1D
forecasting.

# Preliminaries
???
I want to talk about some preliminaries about how to handle
time series.

The first thing you should think about with time series is
what the measurements look like, or how are the measurements
taken.

---

# Measurement frequencies

`$$ (x_{t_1}, y_{t_1}), ... (x_{t_m}, y_{t_m})  \quad t_1 < t_2 < ... < t_m $$`

Equally spaced:

$$ t_{i+1} - t_i = const$$

--
Unevenly spaced:

$$ t_{i+1} - t_i  \quad varies $$

aka "Point processes" in statistics


???
Equally:
- 1 second, 1 day, 1 year
Unevenly:
- Event time series (earthquake, trade, ...)


The simplest case is if the time steps are equally spaced,
from one step to the next is a constant. That sort of makes
it much easier to work with things. If you look at daily
stock prices or weekly measurements of CO2 concentration, or
if you look at daily users, daily sales, something like
that, you have something that is equally spaced. Other
things are like per minute, per second, something like this,
but they’re always at the distance.

The offset obviously is if you have unevenly spaced time
series. This is often the case if you have events. So if you
look at stocks on a very granular level, and look at every
buy and sell event, for example, they would be at arbitrary
times.

---
# Examples

CO2 Measurements]

]
.right-column[
.center[Unevenly spaced
![:scale 100%](images/unevenly spaced data.png)
Volcanic Eruption Deaths]
]

???
Today only evenly spaced.
For uneven: sometimes aggregates over fixed periods make sense


Here are 2 examples of what this looks like. So for example,
on the left, we can see the co2 measurements that are taken
weekly and on the right, there’s people's death and volcanic
eruptions which are taken whenever there is a volcanic
corruption, which is at very irregular interval, but you
still might want to be able to learn from series where the
event happened at irregular intervals.

We’ll mostly talk about the simple case of evenly spaced
time series. For unevenly spaced time series, a common
method is to just aggregate over a fixed period. So if you
have things that happen, for example, at several times
during the day, look at daily averages, or hourly averages.

There are a dataset people often use like bike rides in New
York. Every individual bike ride has like a different start
and end date at completely irregular times but you can say
how many people rode a bike every hour, or how many people
rented a bike in a specific hour, how many people returned a
bike at a specific hour.

This doesn't always make sense so be careful if you do this.
But this is one of the easiest ways to go from unevenly
spaced time series to evenly spaced time series.

The reason for an evenly spaced time series is that
basically all of the models assume this and if you want to
make a prediction, you need to state what you want to make a
prediction for. And so if you have evenly spaced time
series, you can determine when the next step is going to be.
If you don't know when the next time steps are going to be
then it’s much harder to make a prediction.

# Data reading / munging with Pandas

???
So if you work with any time series, I highly recommend you
to work with Pandas. Pandas are really great for time series
data reading/data managing. This is actually one of the main
things Pandas was developed for. Tabular data and time
series are somewhat distinct things, but Pandas does both of
them. The interface is a little bit weird because it tries
to do these two things that are sort of not entirely
related.

.center[![:scale 80%](images/parse dates 2.png)]

???

Multiple columns combined to a single date !

You can parse multiple columns in a data frame together as a
single date.

Parse_dates is very, very flexible, and allows you to
basically parse any string representation of dates into a
date object. You can give it a single column, and it’ll try
it's best to figure out how does the single column represent
the date or here, in this case, I gave it 3 columns, year,
month, day and it just automatically parsed them together.

This is now not just a concatenation of these strings, this
is actually a representation of the date, which is much
harder to get. Don't try to do date parsing yourself, Pandas
is pretty good at it.

Pandas have a lot of time series functionality and it
assumes that the data is indexed by a time series. If you
want to do time series analysis, you really need to use the
index for the time dimension.

---

# Time Series Index

.smaller[
```python
maunaloa = pd.read_csv(url, skiprows=49, header=None, delim_whitespace=True,

                       index_col="year_month_day")
maunaloa.head()
```
]

.center[![:scale 90%](images/time series index.png)]


???
- Can also use set_index if we already read the data it.

You can also set the index column. Here, I set the index
column to year month day. If you already read the data
frame, you can also use the set index function to set the
index to a date time column. This now makes this whole data
frame a different kind of object, because now it's really
representing a time series.

Pandas think quite differently about things that are indexed
by time data.

```python
maunaloa.fillna(method="ffill", inplace=True)  # or bfill
maunaloa.co2.isnull().sum()
```
0
]

- If we resample later, we could also just drop

???
In time series, there's actually a very simple way to do
imputation, which is very stupid, but very common.

So here, there are actually 20 missing values in this whole
series. If we have very few missing values, or if we really
don’t care about the precision as much, there are methods
called FFILL (forward fill) and BFILL (backward fill). They
basically just fill in the last value.

Usually, you don't want to have information from the future
propagate to the past so ffill in many application makes
more sense than bfill.

This is only possible because we set the index to be a time
series index otherwise it wouldn't really make sense to say
I want to forward fill the rows. Here, it looks at the
previous time step and fills it in.

This makes most sense if you have something at regular
intervals. If you want to resample the data like if you have
irregular intervals, or if you think that the data is much
too granular and you want to accumulate it, you can also
just drop the columns. So if afterwards, you're just going
to average, you can just average less values, and it's going
to be fine.

Q: Can the index column be unsorted?

Try and find out.

???
Resampling is helpful if you want different granularity of
your data or if you have data that is with heterogeneous
samples. The resample method in Pandas takes a string which
tells it how to resample.

If I want to represent each resample period, for example, by
its mean, I can do mean and this will give me the mean over
each aggregate period. On the right, we have a table of all
these different periods, MS is month start frequency, it
resamples to months, starting at the start of every month.

There's many more of those. That's mostly because Pandas was
developed in a business context where there are many
different time steps that might be of interest, like
business days, or quarters, or business years, and things
like that.

This is sort of the easiest way in which you can get a
homogenous time series. Here, I have for each month, a
single point indexed with the first day of the month.

---

```python
maunaloa.co2.resample("W").mean().plot(marker="o", markersize=1)
maunaloa.co2.resample("AS").mean().plot(marker="o")
maunaloa.co2.resample("3AS").mean().plot(marker="o")
```]

.center[![:scale 70%](images/maunaloa resample.png)]

???
We can also look at what this looks like. So here I have
weekly averages, yearly averages, and you can also add
multiples, so this is three-year averages. The green one is
just regular time series with 3-year intervals. It's an
important decision to determine the frequency you want to
work on. The green time series looks very different from the
blue time series. There is a very irregular periodic pattern
in the blue time series, and that's completely gone in the
green time series. And the question you have to ask yourself
is, what do we actually care about? Do we care about the
fine grain patterns? Do we only care about the
coarse-grained patterns?

If we care about the fine grain patterns, do we have enough
data to learn them? If you go to fine-grained, at some
point, you’ll usually get noise. So we have to determine the
right granularity to work on, in particular, if you want to
make a forecast.

# 1d Forecasting Basics

???
There's a couple of concepts that are very important for
forecasting. Forecasting is traditionally a very statistics
influenced field.
---
class: spacious

# Stationarity

- Required for some classical statistics methods
- Mean independent of time
- Variance independent of time
- Covariance of two observations k steps apart independent of time

???
FIXME formulas

One of the main assumptions lot of the statistical models
make is stationarity. Stationarity of a time series means
that the mean is independent of time, the variance is
independent of time and covariance between observations k
steps apart is independent of time. So that means basically,
there is no trend, there is no real evolution of the time
series over time. The things that happened yesterday are
sort of the same kind of things that will happen tomorrow.
---

.center[![:scale 75%](images/maunaloa plot.png)]

- Mean changes -> not stationary, there is a trend

???
Here, this time series is not stationary at all. There's a
very clear change of the mean and a very clear trend stating
global warming is getting worse and worse. This is something
where a lot of classic statistical models would not really
work with this well. There are some easy methods to de-trend
time series.

There are also statistical tests to see is the time series
stationary or not. We're not going to go into any of the
stationary tests, and there's many of them. But one thing
you can always do, you can apply the model, see if it works
or if it doesn't work, try to make the time series
stationary or you can use some of the standard models to
make the time series stationary.

# Autocorrelation

$$ R(s,t) = \frac{\operatorname{E}[(X_t - \mu_t)(X_s - \mu_s)]}{\sigma_t\sigma_s} $$
???
12 MONTHS, NOT WEEKS

Autocorrelation basically asks you what does each time step
tell you about the next time step, how much correlation is
there between one-time step and the future.

For each step length, you can compute the autocorrelation
between time s and t. Usually, you look at each data point
or each time step, and then say, 10 times steps in the
futures or 100 times steps in the futures and look at the
correlation between them.

--
.smaller[
```python
ppm = maunaloa.co2

```
```
0.9826
```
```python
ppm.autocorr(lag=52)
```
```
0.9994
```
]
???
The autocorrect() function does the autocorrelation with the
next time step with a lag of 1, and you can see that is
pretty high. It's very close to one meaning each time step
is a very, very good predictor of the next time step.

Lag 12 is even more of a predictor. So this is after 12
weeks, after 12 month things are basically perfectly
correlated, which is also interesting.

.center[![:scale 65%](images/autocorr 2.png)]

???
Fixme axis labels

You can look at all of these different autocorrelations at
the same time by looking at the correlation function.

Another library that has a lot of the time series analysis
in Python is stats models. A lot of the more high level,
more analysis-driven things in Pandas actually use stats
models under the hood. Stats model has a couple of very
helpful methods.

ACF is the autocorrelation function and I pass it my time
series and it computes the autocorrelation. So stats models
actually work directly on data frames, while scikit-learn
does not. And so now I can plot the autocorrelation
function.

Here, by default, it gave me all the lags from 0 to 14. You
can see that the autocorrelation starts at very high and
then decreases over time, but there's also more
autocorrelation in 3 places, in multiples of 12.


---

.smaller[
```python
from pandas.tools.plotting import autocorrelation_plot
autocorrelation_plot(ppm)
```
]

.center[![:scale 80%](images/autocorr.png)]


???
You can also do this directly in Pandas with a little bit
more of a high-level interface.

If you actually want to have access to the autocorrelation
function, you can use it with stat models. If you just want
to do the plot, you can look at the autocorrelation plot.

Here, everything outside of this interval means there's a
significant correlation. And again, you can see there's a
very fine wavy pattern where there's more autocorrelation
every 12 weeks.

# De-trending

- Model trend
- Or differencing (compute new series)....  `$\quad \hat{x_t} = x_{t} - x_{t - 1}$`

.smaller[
```python
ppm.diff().plot()
```]
.center[![:scale 55%](images/detrending.png)]

???
There are 2 main ways to do de-trend a model. Either you
model the trend and subtract it or you difference the time
series. So here, I just differenced the time series, which
is basically computing the gradients. I do every time step
minus the last time step, and it gives me a new time series,
it looks like this.

This now looks much more stationary. The variance, mean and
the covariance doesn't seem to change too much.

Doing this differencing the derivative is a very common
preprocessing method.

]
???
This drop in autocorrelation is related to the trend in the
data. We can also de-trend the data.

Diff is used to de-trend a time series. And if you do
autocorrelation function with this, you can see there are
very strong periodic patterns in here. But the overall
pattern is positive and negative correlations with a very
strong periodicity.

On the right, we have it in more detail. You can see that
things are very, very correlated after 12 weeks, and 24 and
36. This is part of the natural weather cycle.

So the most basic analysis you can do is looking at
stationarity and looking at autocorrelation function. Here,
we discovered there's a lot of correlation and there's a
periodic pattern.

Another quite useful analysis step is trying to
automatically extract these periodic patterns, they're very
common in all kinds of time series.

???
Only for analysis, not prediction.

There's a very simple one built into stats models, which is
tsa.seasonal. And that tries to basically, this is not a
predictive model, it's trying to decompose the data into a
trend and a seasonal model. And it does this basically by
smoothing.

Here, the trend is basically a non-parametric fit to a
smoothed version of the time series. The seasonal model is a
periodic fit to residual of that, and then there's a
residual of these two combined. So the observed data is
basically a sum of all 3.

You can see over the whole time frame, this is very much
dominated by the trend, which goes from, 300 to 400. There's
the seasonal variation that goes from 0.5 to -0.5. And then
there's basically some noise left, but the noise is actually
quite small compared to the rest.

So you can actually understand the signal very well using
this long term trend component that’s very smooth and this
very periodic seasonal component.

This is why people like the time series because it's very
regular, so you can actually do something with it.

So this was more like exploratory analysis, trying to figure
out what does the time series look like.

# Autoregressive (linear) model

- Order k AR model (can include trend and offset):

`$$ x_{t+k} = c_0  x_t + c_1 x_{t + 1} + ... + c_{k - 1} x_t $$`

- learn $c_i$ (i.e. using least squares)

???
The most commonly used methods for being forecasting is
autoregressive models, in particular, autoregressive linear
models. The assumption behind these models is that you can
predict the next time step value as a linear function of
previous time steps.

The last x should be x_(t+(k-1))

So basically, you take the last k steps and you linearly
weight them and then you learn linear regression model that
basically has these constant coefficients, 0, 1 and so on.

So the simplest way is just try to break each next time step
from the last time step, which would mean just learn c_0,
maybe also learn an offset bias or something like that.

You can also obviously think about doing more complicated
models. But these linear models are actually quite common
and pretty simple to implement.

Here, I'm using the AR model, I fitted it on the time
series. Max lag is how many coefficients I want to learn, or
how many time steps I want to look back. We saw that there's
a very strong periodicity in a 12 week periods. So it makes
sense to at least cover 1 period of this periodicity.
Anything shorter will not be able to capture this pattern.

And so here are parameters that the model learned, so these
are just linear coefficients. Only that sort of linear
coefficients is applied to the time series itself. So there
are the constant and 12 values.

Stats models have a bunch of models, but the API is sort of
quite different from scikit-learn and not as homogeneous. So
here, the model gets the time series it's fitting at
instantiation and during fit, it just gets some parameters.
So basically, that's the other way around than it would be
with scikit-learn.

If we want to make a prediction, we take a value to start
from or a history and then do a forecast until a certain
time step.

What this does is to predict the first time step for the
forecast, it looks at the last 12 time steps, uses these
coefficients and makes a prediction. Then it uses this
prediction and the last 11 times steps together to make the
next prediction, and so on. So after 12 time steps, it only
uses previous predictions to make the next prediction. This
way, you can forecast more and more for the future. As you
might expect, the more you forecast the future, the sort of
more uncertain you get, because you always based your
prediction on previous predictions.

Here, it actually covered the periodicity pretty well. So
after a while, the periodicity becomes a little bit too
small and we overpredict a little bit, but generally, you
could say this sort of looks somewhat reasonable. That said,
the order of the model is quite important.

```

.center[![:scale 90%](images/impact of order 2.png)]

???
So here, if I take a maxlag=6, that means I don't actually
cover the whole periodicity.

If I give it a larger lag, the model becomes more powerful
because it has more coefficients. But it also can stabilize
the prediction more. When I start here, it can use more
history to make the first prediction so it always has a
bigger window.

With maxlag=25, which is basically 2 periods, it can do like
a near perfect prediction.

AR model is not really supposed to work with non-stationary
things, but it still does.

If you use too large of a max lag, you would overfit. This
is not overfitting here because I didn't use this in fitting
the model. If I used way too max lag, it would probably
overfit but then the predictions wouldn't be good. I didn't
do a prediction on the training dataset but I could always
make a prediction perfectly on the training dataset by using
more and more lag, but then it would possibly not
generalize. Here, since I'm using a separate test set to
evaluate, I know it's not overfitting.

There's actually a whole family of different models that are
related to this.

???

- More complicated process model
- Internally uses differencing
- Also checkout SARIMAX (state space model)
- Note: typ = "levels" !!


ARIMA is autoregressive integrated moving averages, it's a
more powerful model that tries to build a more complex
statistical model. I tried to tune this whole bunch but I
couldn't really get it to work on this dataset. But I think
it might be that the optimization in stats models is
possibly not ideal, that said, I’m no expert on this.

ARIMA works on difference time series, it then tries to
model the data using moving averages and an autoregressive
model. The order is a combination of the time steps, how
often you want to do differencing and how you want to model
the moving averages.

This is a very commonly used model. Here, in this example,
I’ve provided the data and also the order of instantiation
and provide nothing to fit.

???
Can we actually solve this problem with scikit-learn?

The simplest thing I could do is actually just try to fit
the linear model on the time. So what I'm doing here is
looking at the index and make it a series and I make it in
ordinals. So now I have all the time steps as integers and I
split them into training and test set. And then I just build
a linear model on this. So this basically just fits a line
to the whole dataset.

This helps me a little bit to understand the trend. So
there’s a somewhat linear trend.

.center[![:scale 55%](images/quadratic model.png)]


???
I then used polynomial features. And you can see that it's
actually very well modeled by a quadratic (Polynomial
features by default, use first and second degrees)

If I want to model the trend, I can now try to globally
model the trend with the quadratic. This is very different
from what I did before, where either I tried to get rid of
the trend, or basically, the ARIMA model that worked pretty
well which didn’t have a global model at all, it had a very
local model, just dependent on the last couple of times
steps. Meanwhile here, we're trying to do something much
more global.

So we could use this for example for de-trending.

Here, this is training the model on a training set and then
de-trending on the whole dataset. And it looks like this. So
has much more structure than the difference time series and
maybe this will be easier to fit with the autoregressive

FIXME - Note: Couldn't decrease size further

Here, I guess I'm comparing the maxlag 12 with maxlag 24.
Here the green is the true, the AR predict is the max lag 24
and ar-res is using the polynomial plus the autoregressive
model.

Here, it's a little bit worse trying to de-trend with a
polynomial model, but that's probably just because I gave
the autoregressive model less lag.

So this was trying to model the trend globally and trying to
model it locally with the autoregressive model. We could’ve
also tried to capture the model with a linear regression
model.

Here, I'm adding to the dataset, not only the year_month,
but also the month.

So now I have two features. And I tried to build a linear
model on this. This allows me to model periodicity because
there's a very strong yearly periodicity.

---

.center[![:scale 90%](images/arma month.png)]

???
The periodicity is 12 months, not 12 weeks, as I said
earlier. So here, I have these two features, month of the
year and the global linear model. It doesn't really make a
lot of sense, though, because now I do it as a linear
function of the month because they represent the month as an
integer so you get this weird step in here.

What we really want is we want to learn for each month, what
the level of co2 should be.

.smaller[
```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder
lr_poly_month_ohe = make_pipeline(OneHotEncoder(categorical_features=[1],
												 sparse=False),
                                  PolynomialFeatures(include_bias=False),
                                  LinearRegression())
lr_poly_month_ohe.fit(X_train_month, train)

mean_squared_error(ppm[500:], lr_poly_month_ohe.predict(X_test_month)) #0.505
mean_squared_error(ppm[500:], pred_arma_res) #0.577
```
]

???
So I can one hot encode the month, and then I get this
model. This model is a very simple seasonal model that
learns for each month an offset and the quadratic model.

I find this slightly easier to understand than the AR model
even though it’s worse than the AR model.

In this model, we have a one hot encoding of the month, we
have a global quadratic model. And so we have something like
a 13-dimensional feature space plus the quadratic features.

The r-square of this model is 0.505 while the r-square of
the ARIMA model is 0.577.

I find this a little bit easier to understand because the
ARIMA models basically model relationships between past
values and future values whereas the linear model models the
values directly. So you won't get as much of this drift over
time.

You could now try and engineer more and more features that
would be one way to attack this. Another way would be to use
a different model other than a linear model.

# General Autoregressors

- https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/6029
- Trees work well (as always)
- Can take explanatory variables


???
Maybe, there’s going to be general autoregressive features
in scikit-learn which are very easy to implement yourself,
you can just use like trees or random forest and create a
dataset where the training data is always the last window of
k data points and the target is the next data point.

It’s very easy, given any machine learning algorithm to
build an autoregressive model based on this algorithm. And
trees always works well and it will also work for this.

The autoregressive models work best if there's no trend, but
if there's autocorrelation. Basically, you will look at this
function (slide 27) or this function (2nd in slide 28) if
you want to differencing, and you want to see is there stuff
outside of this band. If there is, then there's
autocorrelation, which means you can use the past values to
predict the future. If you looked at, say, stock prices,
there wouldn’t be any pattern and so you couldn't actually
use the past to predict the future.

# Seasonal Forecasting with FBProphet
- A piecewise linear or logistic growth curve trend. Prophet automatically detects changes in trends by selecting changepoints from the data.
- A yearly seasonal component modeled using Fourier series.
- A weekly seasonal component using dummy variables.
- A user-provided list of important holidays.

https://research.fb.com/prophet-forecasting-at-scale/
???
FIXME formulas


I think it’s very useful to go through these and try to
build a seasonal model yourself to understand what's
happening. But there's actually a very good package for
seasonal modeling provided by Facebook called FB Prophet.

This is an additive model that fits a yearly seasonal and a
weekly seasonal, and then possibly holidays. So this is
really meant for commercial applications where there's often
a weekly seasonal component, if you look at any kinds of
sales data, or any kinds of user data, weekdays and weekends
are very different. Everything is like very much dominated
by these weekly patterns. And this is what this is geared
towards.

So FB prophet only does 1D forecasting and I don't think
they have any explanatory variables so you just do like a 1D
time series forecast, but does it pretty well.

Under the hood this uses Stan. Stan is the framework for
probabilistic modeling. It's actually developed at Columbia.
And it’s very powerful. If you want to install FB prophet,
you’ll have to separately install Stan.

This doesn’t only fit a very simple linear model or
something like this for the growth curve, but it actually
fits probabilistic models on all of these so it keeps
uncertainties about all its estimates. And so this gives you
a pretty good model.

In contrast to the model that we saw from stats models,
which was basically just smoothing and then showing you
decomposition, this is a forecasting model. So you can
actually use the seasonal model to make forecasts.

---
```python
from fbprophet import Prophet
m = Prophet()
m.fit(fb_ppm[:500])
forecast = m.predict(fb_ppm)
```
.center[
![:scale 60%](images/prophet_forecast.png)
]
???
Here, I’m using the seasonal model on the co2 dataset. It
doesn't work that well here because it only uses a linear
trend, it could also use a logistic trend that we saw before
that actually the quadratic trend would be much better.

But it detected here right away and told me there is no
daily and weekly trends. It found out that there are only
yearly trends in this data.

---
# Uncertainty prediction
.center[
![:scale 100%](images/prophet_forecast_uncertainty.png)
]
???
The other thing that you get from this being a probabilistic
model is it very well quantifies uncertainties. So here you
have a mean prediction and a standard deviation prediction,
which allows you to tell you how certain can you be of your
prediction. So here, you can see that the model is very
certain, very certain, very certain, and then keeps getting
more and more uncertain as time goes on. And that's
something that's often very useful if you want to base any
business decisions on this.
---
# Seasonal Components
.center[
![:scale 50%](images/prophet_forecast_components.png)
]
???
detected that there are no daily or weekly trends!

Finally, you get a season decomposition.

I guess there's not more because the only seasonal component
is the yearly one. And so you can see that here, this is
sort of a trended fit, and it uses piecewise linear model so
it finally changed in the trend here. And then it does the
linear model again, and this is sort of the monthly model
that it fitted.

If you have more seasonal trends it will also give you
weekly and daily patterns.

# Where to go from here

- Gaussian Processes

- Recurrent Neural Nets / LSTMs
???
Basically, the tools you want are autoregressive models,
seasonal models, Gaussian processes, which we didn't talk
about in this class, recurrent neural nets and LSTMs.

We talked about RNNs last time, but you can obviously use
these to do time series prediction. And so these are sort of
the more advanced tools that a lot of people use for time
series.

If you actually come across these problems, these are the
kind of tools you want to look into.
