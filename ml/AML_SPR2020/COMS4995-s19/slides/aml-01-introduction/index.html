### W4995 Applied Machine Learning

# Introduction

01/23/19

Andreas C. Müller

???

Hey and welcome to my course on Applied Machine Learning. As you can see we
have a pretty full class so make sure you don’t hog too much space.  I’m
Andreas Mueller, I’m a reseach scientist at the DSI and I spend some of my time working
on scikit-learn development. Also, I'm going on a first name basis with
people in the course, so you can call me Andy. If you have any feedback about
the class, feel free to send me an email or drop by my office hours. Also feel
free to interrupt me with questions. I’m not sure if that’ll work with so big a
class but I’m giving it a go. The goal of this class is to provide you with
the hands-on knowledge you need to be successful in applying machine learning
in the real world. It complements the Machine Learning course, but doesn’t rely
on it.  For those of you who have taken a machine learning class, or who are
taking it now, some things might be a bit redundant, but I promise you there’ll
be a lot of new stuff in this course. Who’s taking machine learning this
semester, raise your hand? And who has taken it before? And who hasn’t?
I'm recording all of these lectures and they'll go up on youtube.

- Six programming assignments<br /><br />
- Grade: 60% homeworks, 20% first exam, 20% second exam<br /><br />
]

???

If you haven’t already, please check out the course website which has the
syllabus and other information. I’ll link to the slides there, too.  The most
up-to-date material will always be on this website and the github repository,
which is linked from there. There will be 6 homeworks, all will be
programming, submitted via github. The homeworks will make up 60% of the grade,
and there’ll be two exams, each making up 20% of the grade.
You can also check out last years' schedule which has slides and videos.
This year will mostly follow the same structure.

# Slides and course materials

.center[
![:scale 40%](images/slides_and_notes.png)
]

Using markdown with remark. Press "p" for notes.

???

As I said, you can find the slides on the website or on github. 
The slides are all written in markdown and on github. 
Hopefully using Markdown will make it easier to provide corrections for the slides.
If you open the slides in the browser, you can press "P" for presenter mode
and you'll see my notes. These are partially transcripts of last years lectures.
I haven't fully proof-read those, so if you find any issues asnd typos, please let me know,
or even better, send me a pull request with fixes.
The same goes for the slides themselves.

# Lecture Recordings
???
All lectures will be recorded and posted publicly.
You can check out last year's lecture to get an idea of what that looks like.
If you're asking a question, the mic might pic you up, and you might end up audible on youtube.
Does anyone have a problem with that? I'll have you fill out a consent form with the first homework.
Really, it's unlikely that it's possible to hear or identify you, but I want to make sure I don't
get sued, and I don't really have the resources to edit all the videos.

---
# Plagiarism and Code copying

- Homeworks are checked for plagiarism
- Copied code will result in 0 points for all involved
- Copying from my slides or online sources (Stack overflow, tutorials, etc. ) is fine.

???
You should acknowledge external sources, you don't have to acknowledge copying from my slides or notebooks.

# Scikit-learn Development

![sklearn logo](images/sklearn_logo.png)

http://scikit-learn.org/dev/developers/contributing.html

???

A couple of you have approached me asking if I have any projects relating to
scikit-learn. Who here is interested in contributing to scikit-learn?  So
answer is yes, there are many many projects. However, currently I don’t have a
lot of time to mentor you on this. This will probably change during the
semester. You are very welcome to start contributing to scikit-learn, though,
and I’m happy to answer questions. There is a pretty extensive guide to
contributing, the link is here. If you want to do a project with me,
the best way is to start solving some of the easy issues on the issue
tracker to get familiar with the project and the workflow before working
on something bigger.

http://ciml.info/]

???

There are three books that I recommend looking into for this course. Definitely
check out my book, Introduction to machine learning with Python. You can find
the PDF on courseworks. My book should be a relatively easy read and it’s quite
short. The second one is Applied predictive modelling by Max Kuhn, which goes a
bit deeper. This is about the level I want to go to in this course. You can get
it for free at springer link, I posted a link in courseworks. These two are
really the essential ones. Finally, there's Elements of statistical learning,
also known as ESL or the stanford book, by Hastie Tibshibani and Friedman is a
classic for a more theoretical view. You can get it for free on the authors
website.

If you want to brush up on your Python skills, I also recommend the Python Data
Science Handbook by my friend Jake Vanderplas. It's linked on the course page
under the prerequisits.

# What and Why of Machine Learning

???

I think I spend enough time on logistics, let’s finally get going. I first
want to talk about what is machine learning, and why do we want it. As you’re
in this course, you’re probably already somewhat convinced that it’s useful,
but I briefly want to give my own perspective. In general, today will not be
very meaty and be more a loose collections of ideas and directions. The next
class we will go down to the metal much more.

---

class: center, middle

# What is machine learning?

???

Machine learning is about extracting knowledge from data. It is closely related
to statistics and optimization. What distinguishes machine learning is that it
is very focused on prediction.

We want to learn from a large dataset how to make decisions for future
observations. You could say that the input to a machine learning program is
the dataset, and the output is a program that can make decisions on future
observations.

Machine learning is really widely used now, and I want to give you some
examples that most of you probably already interacted with today.

---

.center[
![:scale 70%](images/fb1.png)
]

???

Here’s the Facebook news-feed. There’s so much machine learning here, it’s crazy.
Can you point out some of them?
So the most space is a sponsored item. Facebook used ML to know who to show
this too. It’s clearly targetted at developers. Facebook also used ML to know
how much to charge for showing it. Then there’s a post below by a friend.
Facebook ranked that top most interesting to me right now, again ML. Then on
the right, you can see birthdays. It shows only one name, though there’s two
birthdays. Again ML to decide how many and whom to show. Below, trending
topics, apps to connect and people I might now. All ML.

---

.center[
![:scale 70%](images/facebook_gael.png)
]

???

But wait, there’s more. Here’s me uploading a picture. It finds the faces
of many of the people here, even in odd poses. Not only my friend Gael here,
one of the creators of scikit-learn, but also Jared Lander there in the background.

I'm pretty sure they could automatically tag the people, and actually describe the photos,
but that seems to be disabled on my account. My account might still be European,
where they don't tag faces because of privacy concerns.

---

.center[
![:scale 70%](images/fb3.png)
]

???

And then after you post an album, facebook will select some most interesting
pictures for you, and give them different kinds of space, to create a mosaic.

But that’s just facebook. Let’s see what else I’ve got open.

---

.center[
![:scale 70%](images/amazon1.png)
]

???

And then as a last example, amazon. Because google would have been too easy.
Here I’m searching for machine learning. I get a ranked list, using machine
learning. I get sub-categories to search in, via machine learning. Each book
has some features, like top seller etc, added with machine learning.  And
there’s an ad at the top, selected via machine learning.

---

.center[
![:scale 70%](images/amazon2.png)
]

???

And if I click on a book, more machine learning.
There’s an ad below for textbooks, targetted to me. There’s paperback as the
default choice, again machine learning. There’s frequently bought together, and
maybe less obviously, there’s a default seller! The price that is shown on the
right that’s selected for “add to cart” is also selected from a whole pool of
possible amazon sellers via machine learning.

Ok, that’s enough websites I think. While I went through all this, you were
probably on your phone, looking at more output produced by machine learning. My
point is, it’s everywhere. And often non-obvious, as in the case of selecting
a seller here.

# Science!

.center[
![:scale 70%](images/exoplanet.png)
]

???

That was some of the flashy, every day live applications. Something that might
get you VC funding. There’s also a lot of machine learning applications in less
visible, but equally important - or more important - applications in science.
There is more and more personalized cancer treatment – via machine learning.
More medical diagnosis, and more drug discovery are using machine learning.
The higgs boson couldn’t have been found without machine learning, and the same
is true for many earth like planets in other solar systems.
Which is shown using an artists illustration here. In reality you would
have a single pixel, containing the sun and the planet. You can find exoplanets
by checking whether the star gets periodically slightly darker, in which case you found
a planet. Of course with machine learning!
Machine learning is an essential in many data driven sciences now!  So no matter
where you want to go with data, you need machine learning.  But what does that
mean?  Next, I want to give you a little taxonomy of machine learning methods.

class: center, middle

# Types of Machine Learning

???

There are three main branches of machine learning.
Who can name them?
---
class: spacious

# Types of Machine Learning
- Supervised
- Unsupervised
- Reinforcement

???

They called supervised learning, unsupervised learning and reinforcement learning.
What are they?
This course will heavily focus on supervised learning, but you should be aware
the other types and their characteristics. We will do some unsupervised learning,
but no reinforcement learning. Supervised learning is the most commonly used type in
industry and research right now, though reinforcement learning becomes
increasingly important.

---

class: center

# Supervised Learning

.larger[
$$ (x_i, y_i) \propto p(x, y) \text{ i.i.d.}$$
$$ x_i \in \mathbb{R}^p$$
$$ y_i \in \mathbb{R}$$
$$f(x_i) \approx y_i$$
]

???

In supervised learning, the dataset we learn form is input-output pairs (x_i,
y_i), where x_i is some n_dimensional input, or feature vector, and y_i is the
desired output we want to learn.  Generally, we assume these samples are drawn
from some unknown joint distribution p(x, y). In statistics, x_i might be
called independent variables and y_i dependent variable.
What does iid mean?
We say they are drawn iid, which stands for independent identically
distributed. In other words, the x_i, y_i pairs are independent and all come
from the same distribution p. You can think of this as there being some
process that goes from x_i to y_i, but that we don’t know. We write this as a
probability distribution and not as a function since even if there is a real
process creating y from x, this process might not be deterministic.  The goal
is to learn a function f so that for new inputs x for which we don’t observe y,
f(x) is close to y.  This approach is very similar to function approximation.
The name supervised comes from the fact that during learning, a supervisor
gives you the correct answers y_i.

---

# Generalization
.padding-top[
.left-column[
Not only


also for new data:
]

.right-column[$f(x_i) \approx y_i$,


$f(x) \approx y$
]]
???
For both regression and classification, it’s important to keep in mind the
concept of generalization.
Let’s say we have a regression task. We have features, that is data vectors x_i
and targets y_i drawn from a joint distribution. We now want to learn a
function f, such that f(x) is approximately y, not on this training data, but
on new data drawn from this distribution. This is what’s called generalization,
and this is a core distinction to function approximation. In principle we don’t
care about how well we do on x_i, we only care how well we do on new samples
from the distribution. We’ll go into much more detail about generalization in
about a week, when we dive into supervised learning.

class: spacious

# Examples of Supervised Learning

- spam detection
- medical diagnosis
- add click prediction

???

Here are some examples of supervised learning.
Given an array of test results from a patient, does this patient have diabetes?
The x_i would be the different test results, and y_i would be diabetes or no
diabetes.  Given a piece of a satellite image, what is the terrain in this
image? Here x_i would be the pixels of the image, and y_i would be the terrain
types.

This is often used to automate manual labor. For example, you might annotate
part of a dataset manually, then learn a machine learning model from this
annotations, and use the model to annotate the rest of your data.

---

# Unsupervised Learning
$$ x_i \propto p(x) \text{ i.i.d.}$$
Learn about $p$.

???

In unsupervised machine learning, we are just given data points x_i, that are
assumed to be drawn from an unknown distribution. Usually we want to learn
something about these, such as whether they lie on a low-dimensional subspace,
or whether the data clusters in several groups, or find ways to represent the
distribution compactly.  The goal in unsupervised learning is often much less
clear than in supervised learning, and there is no-one providing a “correct”
answers and no supervisor.

Common examples of unsupervised learning is discovering topics in news articles
or on twitter, or grouping data into clusters for easier analysis.  Another one
is outlier detection, where you ask “does this data look normal” which is
important for fraud detection and security systems.

# Reinforcement Learning

.left-column[
![:scale 100%](images/alpha_go.png)
]

.right-column[
![:scale 100%](images/nao.png)
]

???

The third kind, reinforcement learning, has been in the news quite a bit in the
last year. Has anyone heard of that? Alpha go beat the world champion in go.
Reinforcement learning is about an agent learning to interact with an
environment, with some ultimate goal. The environment could be a go board, and
the goal to win the game. For self-driving cars, the the environment could be
roads, sensed by cameras and laser sensors, and the goal would be to get you
somewhere quickly and safely. Or, the environment could be a social media
platform, and the goal could be to provide you such great content that you
never remove your eyes from your phone again!

---

# Explore & Learn

???

Reinforcement learning is quite different in that you usually don’t work with a
dataset – you work with a whole world. This can be a video game, a simulation,
or the real world. The actions of the agent influence which part of the world
they see and which situations they encounter, and it’s usually impossible to
look at all possible situations, even for something as limited as a go board.
This means in reinforcement learning you can not separate data collection and
learning, which you can do for unsupervised and supervised learning.  There
will be no reinforcement learning in this class, as the techniques are quite different,
and real-world use of this technique is still quite limited.

---

# Other kinds of learning

- Semi-supervised
- Active Learning
- Forecasting
- ...

???

There are other kinds of learning that are somewhere between the three kinds I
just explained. Semi-supervised learning for example is a combination of
supervised and unsupervised learning. Active learning is somewhere between
reinforcement learning and supervised learning. There are also many kinds of
supervised learning where the assumption that data points are independent is
dropped, for example for time series analysis and forecasting.  However, if you
get the three main concepts, the rest will be easy to understand.  Some people,
including the local and famous Yann LeCun think that supervised learning is
fundamentally limited. In particular it doesn’t seem to be how humans learn.
So now you can buy these shirts on redbubble

---

class: center, middle

![:scale 50%](images/future_will_not_be_supervised.png)

???

This is the motto of Yann LeCun. Last year I said this is not true yet, this year it might be,
in particular for text processing.
In most cases there is a strong supervised component, though.

---

# Classification and Regression

.left-column[
### Classification
- target y discrete

- Will you pass?
]

.right-column[
### Regression
- target y continuous
- How many points will you get in the exam?
]
???
So getting back to supervised learning, there are two basic kinds, called
classification and regression.
The difference is quite simple: if y is continuous, then it’s regression, and
if y is discrete, it’s classification.

While it's simple, let me give an example.
If I want to predict whether a one of you will pass the class, it’s a
classification problem. There are two possible answers, “yes” and “no”.  If I
want to predict how many points you get on an exam, it’s a regression
problem, there is a continuous, gradual output space.

There are generalizations of this where we try to predict more than one
variable, but we won’t go into that in this course. The main reason the distinction
between classification and regression is important is because the way we
measure how good a prediction is is very different for the two.
It's not always entirely clear whether it's best to formulate a problem as classification
or regression. If you think of predicting a 5-star rating, there's only 5 different possible
outcomes, so you might think it's classification. But there is also an obvious ordering
between the outcomes, which would make it a regression problem.
Both formulations could work, and there are approaches that combine the two for
this particular problem.

---

# Relationship to Statistics

.left-column[
Statistics
- model first
- inference emphasis
]
.right-column[
Machine learning
- data first
- prediction emphasis
]

???

Before I’ll go into some general principles, I want to position machine
learning in relation to statistics. I recently got chewed out by a colleague
for doing that. My goal here is not to say one is better than the other.
Actually, there’s really no clear boundary between statistics and machine learning, and
anyone that tells you otherwise is lying. Two of the books I recommended for the
course are actually statistics text books. But I can tell you how the tools
that I’m talking about in this course will differ from what you’d learn in a
typical stats course.

Statistics is usually about inference, often phrased in terms of hypothesis
testing. An example might be a yes-no-question, such as “are women less likely
to enroll in a Data Science Program”, and you have a sample population, for
example this classroom, and you can then try to make an inference about whether
this statement is true. Often this includes making assumptions on how your
sample relates to the general population, say this class vs all of DSI or
Columbia vs all of the US. You might also have a specific model of how the process
behind your question works.

---

# Relationship to Statistics

.left-column[
Statistics
- model first
- infence emphasis
]
.right-column[
Machine learning
- data first
- prediction emphasis
]

???

On the other hand, machine learning is about prediction and generalization. We
want to learn from past data to predict outcomes on future, unseen data.

We usually want to make statements about individual data points, and we want to
build a model that will work on new data that fulfills our assumptions,
independent of the population we samples. Often we don’t have or need a model
of the process, but we rely on the assumption that our training data is
generated from the same process as any future data will be.

There are statisticians that do predictions and there are machine learning
scientists that do inference, but I find this distinction helpful.

Again I’m not saying one or the other is better, I’m just saying that you should
know what kind of problem you are trying to solve, and what the right tool for
the problem is. And then you can call it machine learning or statistics or
probabilistic inference or data science. The tools you learn in this
class will usually not help you to make yes/no inferences, and they
will only give you a limited insight into the data generating process.

# Guiding Principles in Machine Learning

???

For the rest of todays lecture, I want to talk about some guiding
principles in machine learning applications, and they will hopefully be
something you’ll come back to later. We will revisit some of them at the very
end of the semester in more detail.

---

class: middle

# Goal considerations

???

One of the most important parts of machine learning is defining the goal, and
defining a way to measure that goal. In this way, Kaggle is a really bad way to
prepare you for machine learning in the real world, because they already did
that work for you.  In the real world, people don’t tell you whether you should
use unsupervised learning, supervised learning, classification or regression,
and what’s the right way to cast something as a machine learning task – or
whether to cast it as machine learning at all.

---

class: middle
# The Cost of Complex Systems

## Data driven first? yes! (or maybe)
## Machine Learning first: No!

???

My first advice would be, don’t try machine learning. Machine learning systems
are very complex and often fragile. Whether you’re in research or a startup,
don’t immediately start with "oh we can apply deep learning to this". Often
it’s good to collect data, and be able to use data to drive and evaluate
decisions. But including a complex process like machine learning into whatever
you’re trying to do will make it much harder to debug and much harder to
understand.

---

class: middle

# Thinking in Context!
# What is the baseline?
# What is the benefit?

???

So think in context of your problem. What do you want to achieve? What is the
easiest way to achieve this? And what will improving over this baseline buy
you?

Let’s go through an example:
Imagine you had an electronics store, but you realized retail is all digital
and you’re closing your store with one big sale to move on. You want to do an
email campaign to tell all your customers about the sale. Is there a machine
learning application here? You could try A/B testing the email message. But
that will only work if you have many many customers. You could use ML to
predict which customers might respond. How do you get the data? Let’s say you
have data. What’s the benefit? None! This is your closing sale. You’ll never
email them again. It doesn’t matter if they’ll include you in your spam filter.
Just email everybody!

---

class: middle

# Good and Bad Substitutes

???

The problem of metrics is not unique to machine learning, but a problem in any
data driven decision making. And often you have no choice but to use a
substitute metric, either because the effect you’re interested in is too hard
to measure, or because the influence is too indirect.  Imagine spotify improved
their artist radio to be waaay better. The metric they care about is revenue.
Do you think better radio will increase revenue short-term?
What would be a good substitute metric?

Let's say facebook wants to optimize their ad revenue. What should they measure?
If people click on ads, that's probably good, right? But you can optimize
clicks on ads by increasing accidental clicks by putting ads next to things
people click. But accidental clicks will not yield conversions, and if you sell
clicks to the ad buyers, and they don't result in conversions, they will
go somewhere else.

---

class: middle

# Communicating Results

???

Another very important aspect of machine learning is to be able to communicate
results, and to be able to explain methodologies. If you’re want to use machine learning
in research that's not computer science, you need to be able to
explain why it works. If you automatically make some decisions in your business
applications, you need to convince your boss that nothing crazy will happen.
How do you do that? It’s an important skill to explain what particular results
mean, what their impact will be, and how often a method will work or fail.
Only if you can convince your manager your approach is sensible will your
system go to production.

---

class: middle, center

# Explainable Results

![:scale 60%](images/amazon_explanations.png)

???

Sometimes, you even need to explain to the user why you made a decision. People
found that recommendation engines work much better if the users are shown a
reason for a particular recommendation. Netflix tells you based on what show it
recommends another show, Amazon does the same for products. Interestingly,
this also works even if the explanation is not true. There are systems that
make a recommendation, and then provide a believable “explanation” after the
fact. That gets more engagement than just providing the recommendation, though
some people might question the ethics of that. Earlier I said in ML we are
just interested in good predictions. If you need to be able to explain your
predictions, this is no longer true.

---

class: middle, center

# Sidebar: Ethical Considerations

![:scale 30%](images/propublica_compas.png)<br/>
.compact[https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing]

???

There is another area where explainability and transparency matter, and that is
when people’s lives are at stake.
One aspect of machine learning that only recently is getting some more attention is
ethics. There was a recent article in propublica about racial bias in
risk-assessment used in the criminal justice system. Spoiler alert: it’s bad. I
recommend reading the article, it’s quite interesting. This is a black-box
machine learning system created by some company. If they had to provide
explanations, or a more transparent system, the situation would likely be
better. But this is not the only place where ethics plays a role in machine
learning. There will be a more focused course on ethics in the DSI next semester,
and I really recommend looking into it.

---

class: middle

# Ethics: It’s in the application!

???

Some people think that ethics is not something that the technical people should
care about, but I disagree. I think if you build a machine learning system, you
should know whether and how it is biased, and whether its application is
ethical. Sometimes it’s hard to decide that, though. There’s an example of two
high-schools, both of whom tried to predict which of their students will
underperform in the coming year. There is a lot of ways this could be biased
based on race, financial background and other factors. But that’s not the
point. The point is that one of the schools used the predictions, and kicked
out these students before the annual evaluation, so that they got a better
evaluation score. The other school used the data to provide these students
with targeted support and help. The algorithm could be the same, but the
outcome is quite different. Ok, that’s enough about ethics, I hope you’ll keep
these considerations in mind.
The next thing I want to talk about is data!

---

class: middle

# Data and Data Collection

???

Clearly the data you use for building and applying machine learning systems is
a critical component, and we will talk a lot about handling and transforming
data this semester. Clearly, if you don’t have data, you can’t use machine
learning. Let’s say you have a dataset. A very important question you need to
ask yourself is: should I get more data? That’s another reason why kaggle
competitions are bad: usually you can’t get more data. So what do you think?
Should you get more data?
More data always improves the model if it’s from the right source.
So it depends:
What’s the marginal cost of more data, what’s the marginal benefit to the
model, what’s the marginal benefit of the model to your end-goal?  We will talk
about how to assess the benefit to the model later in the course. But the other
questions are also important.

The cost of data can be very different, and two kinds of data are particularly
common: free data, and very expensive data. What kind of data do you think is
free? 
---

# Free vs Expensive Data 

.left-column[
## Free
Predict observable events
- Stock market
- Clicks
- House numbers
]

.right-column[
## Expensive
Automate complex process
- Dignosis
- Drug Trial
- Chip Design
]

???

Free data is data that you’ll just get more of. And that happens a lot.
If you are running an ad company and want to do click prediction, every day
you’ll get so much new data, you’ll barely be able to use it all.  The same is
true for the stock-market. In general, if you want to predict the future, and
the event is observable, you’ll get more data just by waiting.  This can either
be because the world just produces the  data, or your business process produces
them.  You can also be smart, and ensure your business is set up in a way so
that it does produce the data.
Google used captchas to do OCR and to read house numbers, then they used the
results for machine learning.

The other extreme of the spectrum is when you want to automate an expensive
process with machine learning. This process could be an expert opinion, like a
doctor’s diagnosis, or a literary analysis. It could also be an experiment,
like an initial drug-trial, or measuring the efficiency of a microchip.

# The cost (and benefit?) of BigData

# Subsample to RAM (which can be 512gb)

???

There’s another aspect to data collection and dataset size. More data might be
more expensive to collect, but it might also be more expensive and more
complicated to work with. With the available cloud services, storage might not
be that much of an issue any more. But runtime is. And I’m less concerned about
buying a bigger cluster, I’m more concerned about your time, the data
scientists time and the machine learning analysis.
There’s a reason we’ll be using Python in this course. Python is easy to learn,
has lots of tools and allows very close interactions with the data. If we would
try to use SPARK instead, this would be whole other story. Working with
distributed systems is hard, they are not responsive and the tooling is often
not as good. So what I often do, no matter how big the dataset is, is to work
with a subset of the data that fits into my RAM. Then I can use python, and
everything is easy. And with AWS, I can easily get 512GB of RAM, if I really
need to.
Arguably I'm a bit biased because I work on scikit-learn. For some applications
that subsampling might not make sense, or working on very large data is critical.
But I don't think that should ever be the first step.

# Cornerstones of this Course

- Good software engineering practices
- Problem definition and success measures
- Feature engineering and data cleaning
- Strength and weaknesses of different algorithms
- Model selection best practices

???

So finally some notes about my philosophy for this course. There are a couple
of things I want to emphasize. One is good software engineering practices.
Machine learning systems are usually more complex than traditional software,
and so good software engineering is even more important, and that’s where we’ll
start in the next lecture.
One thing that we discussed today and that will also be part of the assignments
is problem formulation and choosing the right evaluation measure. That’s
something that’s critical in the real world, but not part of your usual course
or ml competition.
There are things that are often not taught in class, but you can learn at
machine learning competitions are feature engineering, data cleaning and model
choice.
And it’s not only important to know which models to try, it’s also important to
apply best practices in model selection to ensure your models will perform well
in the real world.

# The Machine Learning Work-Flow

![:scale 100%](images/ml-workflow.png)

Taken from MAPR https://www.mapr.com/ebooks/spark/08-recommendation-engine-spark.html

???

Here is one possible depiction of the overall machine learning workflow.
In this class, I attempt to cover as many aspects of this as possible,
only leaving out the data collection.
I stole this illustration from a book on recommendation engines, but I mostly
agree with it.
Everything starts with the data generating process, in this diagram it’s the
user. You ingest the data, and preprocess it. Some of the preprocessed that is
held out for model validation. The rest is used for actually building the
model. Then, there’s the model debugging loop. You get results and you want to
improve them. That’s what’s shown as the train-test-loop. I would argue
sometimes this loop goes further back, and maybe you discover an issue as early
as in the ingestion. In the end, you find a model that you like, and you deploy
it. However, that’s not the end of the story! If you’re working with a life
system, the deployed model is likely to change user behavior, which means your
input data changes, and your model might not be applicable any more! That
feedback loop is really tricky, and we won’t go into that in this course. It’s
good to keep in mind when you all create your first startup, though.

# General coding guidelines

???
Next, I want to talk about Python and some software engineering
principles. But before we do that, I want to mention two famous quotes
that provide great general guidelines for software development.

---
class: middle

Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for
machines to execute.
.quote_author[Harold Abelson (wizard book)]

???
The first one is by Harold Abelson from the foreword of “structure
and interpretation of computer programs” a classic in programming
languages and compilers.
[read]
The gist is that the main point of code is to communicate ideas to your
peers and to your future self.
A similar sentiment is expressed in the statement that “code is read
more often than it is written”. Take more time writing code, so that
you and other can spend less time reading it. Don’t focus on what’s
“easy for the computer” or “elegant”. Focus on what’s easy to
understand for people.

Everyone knows that debugging is twice as hard as writing a program in
the first place. So if you're as clever as you can be when you write it,
how will you ever debug it?
.quote_author[Brian Kernighan]

???
This one is from Brian Kernighan, who wrote the first book on C together
with Dennis Richie. Kernighan is also the creator of awk and many other
parts of unix, in particular the name. He says
[read]
This is another call for simplicity. Make code easy to understand. For
yourself now to debug, for your future self to know what the hell you were
thinking, and for others that might want to use this code in the future.
Hopefully all the code you write will be read again. Otherwise, what’s
the point? That might not be true for your assignments in most classes,
but the point of the assignments it to practice for the real world. So I
want to make sure that the code that you write in class is on the same
standard that it needs to be out there on your job. Also, think of the
poor course assistants.

class: padding-top

- Don’t be clever!


- Make it readable!


- Future you is the most likely person to try to understand your code.



???
So to summarize:
[read]

And there's one more trick to making your code readable and understandable.
Don't write code. The more you write, the more you need to read. If you can
avoid writing code, do it! If you can get a 10% speedup by making your code
three times as long, usually it's not worth it.

- Avoid writing code.

# Python basics

???
So now I want to go over some Python basics. And don’t worries, we
won’t go over syntax or the standard library.

---
class: spacious

# Why Python?

- General purpose language
- Great libraries
- Easy to learn / use
- Contenders: R (Scala? Julia?)

???
First, a short defense on why I’m teaching this class in Python.
Python is a general purpose programming language, unlike matlab or R,
so you can do anything with it.
It is very powerful, mostly because there are so many libraries for
python that you can do basically anything with just a couple of lines.
Python is arguably easy to learn and easy to use, and it allows for a
lot of interactivity.
The only real contender in the data science space that I can think of
is R, which is also a good option, but well, I’m not an R guy. Much
of this course could be taught in R instead, though the software
development tooling is a bit worse (but other things are better).
You might have better chances with Python in industry jobs.
There’s also Scala, but I’d argue that’s way too complicated and
doesn’t have the right tools for the kind of data analysis and machine
learning we want to do in this course.

# The two language problem

Python is sloooow…


- Numpy: C
- Scipy: C, fortran
- Pandas: Cython, Python
- Scikit-learn: Cython, Python

- CPython: C

???
So there’s one thing that I really  don’t like about Python. Any
idea what that is?
Python is slooow. Like really slow.
So you know all these great libraries for Python for data science, like
numpy, scipy, pandas and scikit-learn. Do you know what language they
are written in?
Numpy is written in C,
Scipy is written in C and Fortran, pandas and scikit-learn are written
in Cython and Python. And Cpython, the interpreter we use, is written
in … C obivously
That creates a bit of a divide between the users, who write python,
and the developers, who write C and Cython. I have to admit, I don’t
write a lot of Cython myself, mostly Python… but that’s not great.
So you need to be aware that if you actually want to implement new
algorithms, and you can’t express them with pandas and numpy, you
might need to learn cython.
For this course, this won’t really be a problem, though. We’ll stay
firmly on the Python side.

# Python 2 vs Python 3

- “current” : (2.7), 3.6, 3.7

- Don't use Python 2

???
There’s another thing that you could call the two language problem,
it’s python 2 vs python 3.
The last version of python 2 is python 2.7, and really no-one should be
using anything earlier. The commonly used versions of python 3 are 3.6 and 3.7.
There is really no reason to use python 2 any more and scikit-learn already doesn't
support it in it's current development version, same for numpy and matplotlib. Unless you already
wrote lots of code earlier. If you’re at a company it might not be
easy to make the  transition, and that’s why python 2 is still around.

So the important part are the changes. Anyone know what changed?

# Python ...

Package management:

- don't use system python!

- use Virtual environments

- understand pip (and wheels)

- probably use Conda (and anaconda or conda-forge)

???
Package management is really important if you want to become a serious python user.
Unfortunately, it’s a bit tricky, partly due to the two language problem, which
means packages have dependencies that are not in python.
First of, you should be aware of the environment you are using. Usually
it’s a good idea to work with virtual environments, in which you can
control what software is installed in what version. If you’re on OS X
or linux, your system will com with some python, but you don’t really
want to mess with that. Create your own environments, and are aware of
which environment you are using at any moment.
The standard python way to install packages is pip, which is part of
the setuptools package. Pip allows you to install all python packages in the pipy
repository, which is basically all of them.

--
???
Until not so long ago, pip needed to compile all C code locally on your
machine, which was pretty slow and complicated. Now, there are binary distributions,
called wheels, which mean no compilation for most packages! If you’re compiling
something when you’re installing, you’re probably doing it wrong.
The issue with pip is that it only works for python packages, and some
of our packages rely on linear algebra packages like blas and lapack,
and you need to install them some other way.
A really easy work-around for that is using a different package manager,
called conda. It was created by a company called Anaconda (used to be continuum
IO) and they ship a bundle called anaconda, which installs basically all the
important packages. I recommend you use that for the course.
Conda can be used with different source repositories. By default, it uses
the anaconda one that is managed by the company. There’s also an open
repository that is managed by the community that’s called conda-forge.
In practice I use both conda and pip.

# Pip and conda and upgrades

- Pip upgrade works on dependencies (unless you do -no-dep)

- pip has no dependency resolution!

- conda has dependency resolution

- Use conda environments!

- upgrading a conda package with pip (or vice versa) will break stuff!

???
Oh and one word of warning: if you do pip upgrade somepackage, it will
also update all the dependencies. That is often not what you want, in
particular if you are using it in a conda environment or if you installed
a particular version of numpy or scipy that you don’t want upgraded.
An imporatant thing to keep in mind about pip is that it has no dependency
resolution, which means it will install the dependencies for any
package you install, but it won't care about all the packages you installed
before. So whenever you're using pip to install something, it could potentially
break an already installed package.
Conda on the other hand has a dependency resolution mechanism, which means
it'll ensure that all the packages that you installed are compatible with each other.
Sometimes there are conflicts between packages, though, which might prevent
you from installing certain combinations.
The solution here is to make liberal use of conda environments.
If you need to work on a specific project, you should have a conda environment
for that project ant it's requirements. Conda environments are really very useful
and easy to use.

Finally, don't try to upgrade a package with pip if it was installed
with pip or the other way around. So if you mix conda and pip, make sure
you check which one you used before upgrading. I recommend to use conda
whenever possible.

# Environments and Jupyter Kernels
.smaller[
- Environment != kernels
- Use nb_conda_kernels or add environment kernels manually:

.smallest[
```bash
source activate myenv
python -m ipykernel install --user --name myenv --display-name "Python (myenv)"
source activate other-env
python -m ipykernel install --user --name other-env --display-name "Python (other-env)"
```

.right-column[
![:scale 100%](images/kernel_other_env2.png)
]
???

If you're using conda environments, you will want to use them in your jupyter notebooks.
However, jupyter is not immediately aware of your environments. Jupyter runtime environments
are defined by kernels, which can be python environments, or different programming languages.
You need to make sure that jupyter is aware of your environments to use them as a kernel.
One way is to manually add them by using this command here which invokes `ipykernel install`.
That works with any kind of python environment.
For conda environments specifically, you can also install the `nb_conda_kernels` package,
which will automatically create kernels for all environments that contain the `ipykernel`
package. If you do either of them, you'll get a choice of which kernel you want to use for
a notebook. That's a great way to use different versions of python, like 2 and 3, or different
versions of scikit-learn or matplotlib or anything else.

There is a bit more tooling around python that I want to talk about next.

# Dynamically typed, interpreted

- Invalid syntax lying around

- Code is less self-documenting

???
One of the reasons Python is so easy to learn and use is because it’s
a dynamically typed languages.
So who of you have worked with statically typed languages like C, C++,
Java or Scala?
It’s often a bit cumbersome that you have to declare the type of
everything, but it provides some safety nets. For example you know that
if the code compiles, the syntax is correct everywhere. You don’t know
whether the code does what you want, but you know it’ll do something.
Mabye crash your machine, but whatever.
Also, arguably, dynamically typed code is less self-documenting. If I write a
function without documentation, it’s very hard for you to guess what I
expect the input types to be. There’s now type annotations for Python,
which is great, but they are not supported in Python2 and are not adopted
everywhere yet. So how can we get back our safety nets?

# Editors

- Flake8 / pyflake

- Scripted / weak typing: Have a syntax checker!

- write pep8 (according to the standard, not the tool)

- use autopep8 if you have code lying around

???
One of the simplest fixes is to have a syntax checker in your
editor. Whatever editor you’re using, make sure you have something like
flake8 or pyflake installed that will tell you if you have obvious errors.
These will also tell you if you have unused imports, undeclared variables
or unused variables. All that helps you to immediately fix problems,
and not wait until you run your program.
I also recommend having a style checker. Flake8 also enforces pep8,
which is the python style guide.
You should write pep8 compatible code. It will make it easier for others
to read your code, and once you’re used to it, it’ll make it easier
for you to read other’s code.
If you want to convert code to be pep8 compatible, check out the autopep8
package. The pep8 tool is very strict these days, and I don't heed
all the warnings. There is a configuration file you can use to silence
the more obnoxious ones. When I say you should write pep9, I mean
you should write according to the standard, not the tool.
The first guideline of pep8 is to use your own judgment and not
blindly follow the guide.
