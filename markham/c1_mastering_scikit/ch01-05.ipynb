    "To start, we're going to use logistic regression as our model. It's a good default choice for classification problems because it's both fast and interpretable.\n",
    "\n",
    "We import it from the linear_model module, and then we create an instance called logreg. This is our model object.\n",
    "\n",
    "The default solver for logistic regression has changed between different scikit-learn versions, but in this course I'm going to set the solver to liblinear. I'm specifying the solver explicitly and setting a value for random_state so that if you run the same code at home, you will most likely get the same results as me.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's now talk about model evaluation. The goal of model evaluation is to simulate how a model will perform on future data so that we can choose between models today. To do model evaluation, we need both an evaluation procedure and an evaluation metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "The procedure we will use is K-fold cross-validation. Another option is to use train/test split, but cross-validation is generally superior because it gives a lower variance estimate of model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The metric we will use is classification accuracy. There are many other classification metrics we could have chosen, but accuracy is suitable for this problem for two reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "- First, there is not significant class imbalance.\n",
    "- And second, predicting the positive class correctly is just as important to us as predicting the negative class correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "That being said, I will cover other classification metrics in the chapters on class imbalance.\n",
    "\n",
    "With such a small dataset, we're going to use 3-fold cross-validation, rather than 5 or 10 folds which is more typical. Let me briefly review what happens during 3-fold cross-validation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The rows are split into 3 subsets, which we'll call A, B, and C.\n",
    "- First, A and B together become the training set, and C becomes the testing set. The model is trained on the training set, the trained model makes predictions for the testing set, and those predictions are evaluated.\n",
    "- Next, A and C together become the training set, and B becomes the testing set. Again, the model is trained, it makes predictions, and the predictions are evaluated.\n",
    "- Finally, B and C together become the training set, and A becomes the testing set. The training, predicting, and evaluation process happens one final time.\n",
    "- Because the evaluation process occurred 3 times, it returns 3 scores, and we will usually take the mean of those scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's go ahead and use cross-validation to evaluate our model:\n",
    "\n",
    "- First we import the cross_val_score function from the model_selection module.\n",
    "- Then we pass it the model object, X and y, the number of cross-validation folds, and the evaluation metric. Although the default metric for classification problems is accuracy, I recommend specifying it explicitly so that there's no ambiguity.\n",
    "- When we run cross_val_score, it does the dataset splitting, training, predicting, and evaluation. 3 accuracy scores are returned, and the mean of those scores is 69%.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you received a different result, that's not a problem. The results can vary based on your scikit-learn version due to changes in the default parameters, algorithm changes, bug fixes, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, we can't take these results seriously because the dataset is so small. There's actually no reliable evaluation procedure when your training data only contains 10 rows, but I did want to demonstrate it anyway to emphasize that model evaluation is a normal part of the Machine Learning workflow.\n"

    "- Second, the model object is modified in-place when you run the fit method, and so there's no need to overwrite the logreg object using an assignment statement.\n",
    "- Third, scikit-learn understands how to work with pandas objects, and so we can pass X and y directly to the fit method.\n",
    "- And finally, if you're using scikit-learn 0.23 or later, you will only see the parameters that have changed from the defaults when you print or fit a model. That's why it only displays the random_state and solver parameters, whereas in previous versions of scikit-learn, all model parameters would have been displayed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's read in a new dataset for which we don't know the target values. You can read it from a URL or from your local computer, so choose whichever option you prefer. Again, we are only going to keep the first 10 rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll notice that it has the same columns as the df DataFrame, except that there's no Survived column, which is the column that we're going to predict.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we make predictions, we have to define X_new. It has to have the same columns as X, and those columns have to be in the same order.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we'll use the trained model to make predictions by passing X_new to the predict method, which outputs a NumPy array. There are 10 predictions because it makes 1 prediction for each sample in X_new.\n",
    "\n",
    "The predictions are in the same order as the samples in X_new, meaning the first prediction is for the first row in X_new, the second prediction is for the second row in X_new, and so on.\n",

The classic example of this is classifying the topic of a document. For example, a document might be about politics, religion, or law, or it might fit into multiple topics at once.\n",

In those cases, it's less appropriate to interpret their predicted probabilities as confidence levels.

   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "When I ran cross_val_score earlier in this chapter, I passed an integer, 3 in this case, that specified the number of cross-validation folds.\n",
    "\n",
    "This code shows you what happens \"under the hood\" when you specify cv=3 for a classification problem. I'm going to walk through this code so you understand what's happening and you can modify it when needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, you'll notice that we're importing a class called StratifiedKFold. It's known as a cross-validation splitter, which means that its role is to split datasets. We create an instance of this class and pass it a 3 so that it will create 3 folds. And then we can pass this instance to cross_val_score instead of an integer.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's called StratifiedKFold because it uses stratified sampling to ensure that the class proportions are approximately equal in each fold. For example, if 40% of the passengers in the dataset survived, then stratified sampling ensures that about 40% of each fold is survived passengers.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, it ensures that each fold is representative of the entire dataset. Stratified sampling is desirable because it produces more reliable cross-validation scores, and again, scikit-learn will do this for you by default.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another good thing to know about StratifiedKFold is that by default, it does not shuffle the samples before splitting. Thus, there is nothing random about this process, and as such you will get the same results every time you run cross_val_score.\n",
    "\n",
    "In most cases, it doesn't matter whether you shuffle the samples before splitting. However, if the order of the samples in your dataset is not arbitrary, then it's important to randomly shuffle the samples when cross-validating.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, you could imagine that if your dataset was sorted by one of the features, then some folds would only have high values of that feature and other folds would only have low values of that feature, which could result in unreliable cross-validation scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you do need to shuffle the samples, you simply modify the cross-validation splitter by setting shuffle to True, and then pass that splitter object to cross_val_score. Note that because you are introducing randomness into the process by shuffling, you should also set a random_state to ensure reproducibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, if you have a classification problem and the samples are in an arbitrary order, you can just pass an integer to the cv parameter of cross_val_score, and it will use stratified sampling without shuffling.\n",
    "\n",
    "If your samples are not in an arbitrary order, you should use StratifiedKFold as your splitter and set shuffle to True, and then pass the splitter object to the cv parameter of cross_val_score, as I did above.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, it's worth mentioning that if you're working on a regression problem instead, and you need to shuffle the samples, you should use the KFold class instead of the StratifiedKFold class, because stratified sampling does not apply to regression problems."

We'll talk about the fit_transform method in the next lesson, but for now I just want to highlight that we'll use double brackets around Embarked to pass it as a single-column DataFrame instead of using single brackets to pass it as a Series.\n",

A one-dimensional Series could be interpreted either as a single feature or a single sample, whereas our two-dimensional DataFrame signals to scikit-learn that this is indeed a single feature.\n",

Each row contains a single 1, and the rest of the values in the row are 0. 100 means \"C\", 010 means \"Q\", and 001 means \"S\", which you can confirm by comparing it to the Embarked column in our DataFrame.\n",

    "\n",
    "Let's now look at the categories attribute of the OneHotEncoder. You can think of it as the column header for our 10 by 3 array. In other words, the categories attribute tells you that the first column represents C, the second column represents Q, and the third column represents S. Because the categories are always in alphabetical order from left to right, I didn't actually have to examine the categories attribute in order to know how to interpret it.\n",

    "\n",
    "You can think of it this way: OneHotEncoder creates a feature from each level so that the model can learn the relationship between each level and the target value. In this case, the model can learn the relationship between the target value of Survived and whether or not a passenger embarked at a given port.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the model might learn from the first feature that passengers who embarked at C have a higher survival rate than passengers who didn't embark at C. This is similar to how a model might learn from a numeric feature like Fare that passengers with a higher Fare have a higher survival rate than passengers with a lower Fare.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, you might be wondering whether we could have instead encoded Embarked as a single numeric feature with the values 0, 1, and 2 representing C, Q, and S. The answer is that yes, we can do this, but it's generally not a good idea to do this with unordered categories because it would imply an ordering that doesn't inherently exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "To see why it's not a good idea, let's pretend that passengers who embarked at C and S had high survival rates, and passengers who embarked at Q had low survival rates. There would be no way for a linear model like logistic regression to learn that relationship if Embarked is encoded as a single feature since a single feature can't be assigned both a negative coefficient to represent the impact of Q with respect to C and a positive coefficient to represent the impact of S with respect to Q.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, encoding Embarked as a single feature would prohibit a linear model from learning a non-linear relationship in the data, which is why encoding it as multiple features is generally the better choice.\n"

    "\n",
    "To do this, we simply pass a two-column DataFrame to the fit_transform method, whereas previously we had passed a one-column DataFrame. It outputs 5 columns, in which the first 3 columns represent Embarked and the last 2 columns represent Sex.\n",
    "\n",

    "Earlier in this chapter, we used the fit_transform method of OneHotEncoder to encode two categorical features. In this lesson, I'll show you when it's appropriate to just use the transform method instead of fit_transform. The example below will use OneHotEncoder, but the principles I'm teaching here apply the same way to all transformers.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll start by creating a DataFrame of training data with just 1 categorical feature. Let's run fit_transform on the entire DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that fit_transform is really 2 steps. During the first step, which is fit, the OneHotEncoder learns the 3 categories. During the second step, which is transform, the OneHotEncoder creates the feature matrix using those categories. It outputs a 4 by 3 array, since there are 4 samples and 3 categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we'll create a DataFrame of testing data. It contains the same feature, but that feature includes one less category. What would happen if we ran fit_transform on the testing data?\n",
    "\n",
    "The output array only includes two columns, because the testing data only included two categories. The first column represents the A category, and the second column represents the C category.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is problematic, because if we trained a model using the 3-column feature matrix, and then tried to make predictions on the 2-column feature matrix, it would error due to a shape mismatch. That makes sense because if you train a model such as logistic regression using 3 features, it will learn 3 coefficients, and it expects to use all 3 of those coefficients when making predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution is to run fit_transform on the training data, and only run transform on the testing data. Let's take a look at the output arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that the categories are represented the same way in both arrays: the first column represents A, the second column represents B, and the third column represents C.\n",
    "\n",
    "This happened because we only ran the fit method once, on the training data, and the fit method is when the OneHotEncoder learns the categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we ran the transform method twice, both on the training data and the testing data. Because we didn't run the fit method on the testing data, the categories learned from the training data were applied to both the training and testing data. This is critically important because it means that both our training and testing feature matrices have 3 columns, and those 3 columns mean the same thing.\n",

    "In the previous lesson, we created this example DataFrame of training data. When we passed that DataFrame to fit_transform, the output array included three columns. We know from the categories attribute that those columns represent the categories A, B, and C.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we'll create a new DataFrame of testing data that includes a category, D, which was not seen in the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you pass this new DataFrame to the transform method, it will throw an error because it doesn't know how to represent the D category. It only knows how to represent the A, B, and C categories because those are the ones that were seen by the OneHotEncoder during the fit step.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two possible solutions to this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first solution is to specify the categories manually to the OneHotEncoder when creating an instance. Then, when fit_transform is run on the training data, a column is reserved for each of the four categories. As a result, the transform on the testing data will no longer error.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, specifying the categories manually is only a useful solution if you know all possible categories that might ever appear in your data. But in the real world, you don't always know the full set of categories ahead of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, there might be rare categories that aren't present in your set of samples, or new categories might be added in the future. For example, if one of your categorical features was medical billing codes, you could imagine that new billing codes are added over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you don't know all possible categories, then the solution is to set the handle_unknown parameter of the OneHotEncoder to ignore, which overrides the default value of error.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's use the fit_transform method on our training data one more time. The output array includes three columns representing A, B, and C. Now, when you use the transform method on the testing data, the third sample is encoded as all zeros because D is an unknown category.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although this might seem strange, this is actually quite a reasonable approach since you don't have any information from the training data about the relationship between the D category and the target value.\n",
    "\n",
    "One limitation of this approach, however, is that all unknown categories will be encoded the same way, which means that an E value in the testing data would also be encoded as all zeros.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's my overall advice:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. When starting a project, keep the handle_unknown parameter set to its default value of error so that you will know if you are encountering new categories in your testing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. If you do find that you're encountering new categories, but you can determine the full set of categories through research, then define the categories manually when creating the OneHotEncoder instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. If you can't determine the full set of categories, then set the handle_unknown parameter to ignore. However, you should retrain your model as soon as possible using data that includes those new categories."

    "Here's the example training data that we've used in the past few lessons. And here's the default one-hot encoding of this DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "When one-hot encoding, it's somewhat common to drop the first column of the output array because it contains redundant information and because it avoids collinearity between features.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to drop the first column, you can set the OneHotEncoder's drop parameter to first, though this option only exists in scikit-learn version 0.21 and later. When you run the fit_transform, you can see that the output array contains 1 less column. However, the new encoding retains the same information, since each category is still represented by a unique code: 00 means A, 10 means B, and 01 means C.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dropping the first column will work regardless of the number of categories, but you're only ever allowed to drop a single column. And it doesn't actually matter which column you drop, though the convention is to drop the first column.\n",
    "\n",
    "You've now seen that you can drop the first column, but the question is, should you drop the first column? Here's my advice.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you know that perfectly collinear features will cause problems, such as when feeding the resulting data into a neural network or an unregularized regression, then it's a good idea to drop the first column. However, for most scikit-learn models, perfectly collinear features will not cause any problems, and thus dropping the first column will not benefit the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also some significant downsides to dropping the first column that you need to be aware of.\n",
    "\n",
    "Number one, dropping the first column is incompatible with ignoring unknown categories, which is the handle_unknown='ignore' option that we saw in the previous lesson, since the dropped category and unknown categories would both be encoded as all zeros. You are allowed to do this starting in scikit-learn 1.0, but I still don't recommend it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Number two, dropping the first column can introduce bias into the model if you standardize your features, such as with StandardScaler, or if you use a regularized model, such as logistic regression, since the dropped category will be exempt from standardization and regularization.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, I recommend that you drop the first column only if you know that perfectly collinear features will cause problems, otherwise I don't recommend dropping the first column."

    "Throughout this chapter, we used one-hot encoding to encode unordered categorical features, also known as nominal data. But how should you encode categorical features with an inherent logical ordering, also known as ordinal data? That's the subject of this lesson.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a look at our Titanic DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pclass, which stands for passenger class, is an ordinal feature. Although it's already numeric, the numbers 1, 2, and 3 represent the categories 1st class, 2nd class, and 3rd class. It's considered ordinal data because there is a logical ordering to the categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our intuition is that there may be a relationship between Pclass values increasing and survival rate decreasing, because passengers in the lower-numbered classes may have gotten priority access to lifeboats. Thus if we were going to include Pclass in the model, we would keep the existing numeric encoding so that the model can learn the relationship between Pclass and Survived with a single feature. You could use one-hot encoding with Pclass instead, but the model wouldn't be able to learn that relationship as effectively because that information would be spread out across three features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's create an example DataFrame to see how to handle ordinal features that are stored as strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this DataFrame, we have two ordinal features, Class and Size. If you have ordinal data, you should use the OrdinalEncoder class to do the encoding. First, you import it from the preprocessing module. Then, you create an instance of OrdinalEncoder, and when you do so, you define the logical order of the categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "We pass a list of lists to the categories parameter, in which the first inner list is the categories for the Class feature, and the second inner list is the categories for the Size feature. I put the two lists in that order because that is the order in which I'll be passing the features to the fit_transform method.\n",
    "\n",
    "One important note is that I included the M category for Size even though it wasn't present in this DataFrame because I knew that it would occur in the dataset at some point.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we pass the DataFrame to the OrdinalEncoder's fit_transform method in order to do the encoding. You'll notice that each input feature became a single feature in the output array.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the Class feature, first was encoded as 0, second was encoded as 1, and third was encoded as 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the Size feature, S was encoded as 0, L was encoded as 2, and XL was encoded as 3. And if M appears in the data at some point, it will be encoded as 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, we encoded each input feature as a single column so that the model can learn the relationship between the target and an increase or decrease in each feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's briefly contrast this with the output you would get if you used OneHotEncoder with these same two features.\n",
    "\n",
    "OneHotEncoder would create 7 columns in the output array, since Class has 3 categories and Size has 4 categories. These 7 columns contain the same information as the 2 columns output by OrdinalEncoder, but the model would have a comparatively harder time learning from the 7 columns since the information is expressed in a less compact form.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a summary of my advice on this topic:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If you have an ordinal feature that's already encoded numerically, then leave it as-is.\n",
    "2. If you have an ordinal feature that's stored as strings, then encode it using OrdinalEncoder.\n",
    "3. If you have a nominal feature, then encode it using OneHotEncoder.\n",
    "\n",
    "In chapter 17, we'll explore this topic further and see if there are cases in which you should diverge from this advice.\n",
    "\n",
    "One final note about OrdinalEncoder is that unlike OneHotEncoder, it does not allow for new categories in the testing data that were not seen during training. However, that functionality is available beginning in scikit-learn version 0.24 using a handle_unknown parameter."

   "source": [
    "There are many similarities between the OrdinalEncoder and LabelEncoder classes, so in this lesson I'll explain how they're different and why you should be using OrdinalEncoder, not LabelEncoder.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first main difference is that OrdinalEncoder allows you to define the order of the categories, whereas LabelEncoder does not. LabelEncoder simply uses the alphabetical order of the values you pass to it to determine which value to encode as 0, which value to encode as 1, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second main difference is that OrdinalEncoder can be used to encode multiple features at once, whereas LabelEncoder can only encode one column of data at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of these differences, OrdinalEncoder is much better suited than LabelEncoder for encoding ordinal features. And in fact, LabelEncoder is only intended for the encoding of class labels, hence its name.\n",
    "\n",
    "You might be asking why LabelEncoder even exists, given its limitations. There are two reasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, in older versions of scikit-learn, some classification models were not able to handle string-based labels. LabelEncoder was used to encode those strings as integers so that they could be passed to the model. That limitation was removed a few years ago, and so all scikit-learn classifiers can now handle string-based labels. Therefore, you should never need to use LabelEncoder for encoding your class labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, also in order versions of scikit-learn, OneHotEncoder did not accept strings as input. Thus if you had categorical data stored as strings, you actually had to use LabelEncoder to encode the strings as integers before passing them to the OneHotEncoder. Again, that limitation was removed a few years ago, and so you can pass string-based categorical data directly to OneHotEncoder.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of this legacy from older versions of scikit-learn, many people are familiar with LabelEncoder and thus use it to encode features. However, the best practice is to use OrdinalEncoder to encode ordinal features. In fact, it's rare that you will ever need to use LabelEncoder, which is why I'm not using it in this course."

  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "source": [
    "Normally, when you have a continuous numeric feature such as Fare, you pass that feature directly to your Machine Learning model. However, one strategy that is sometimes used with numeric features is to \"discretize\" or \"bin\" them into categorical features. In scikit-learn, we can do this using KBinsDiscretizer.\n",
    "\n",
    "When creating an instance of KBinsDiscretizer, you define the number of bins, the binning strategy, and the method used for encoding the result. Here's the output when we pass the Fare feature to the fit_transform method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because we specified 3 bins, every sample has been assigned to bin 0 or 1 or 2. The smallest values were assigned to bin 0, the largest values were assigned to bin 2, and the values in between were assigned to bin 1. Thus, we've taken a continuous numeric feature and encoded it as an ordinal feature, and this ordinal feature could be passed to the model in place of the numeric feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "The obvious follow-up question is: Should we discretize our numeric features? Theoretically, discretization can benefit linear models by helping them to learn non-linear trends. However, my general recommendation is to not use discretization, for three main reasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, discretization removes all nuance from the data, which makes it harder for a model to learn the actual trends that are present in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, discretization reduces the variation in the data, which makes it easier to find trends that don't actually exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "Third, any possible benefits of discretization are highly dependent on the parameters used with KBinsDiscretizer. Making those decisions by hand creates a risk of overfitting the training data, and making those decisions during a tuning process adds both complexity and processing time, and so neither of those options is particularly attractive to me."
