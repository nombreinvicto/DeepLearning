Description:

This mini project repository contains source code that implements the 
function 
of a single layer Perceptron network  that are the basic 
building blocks of Neural Networks. A step activation function has 
been employed as an output activator for the output layer and the 
coded perceptron has been trained to segregate outputs originating 
from OR, AND and XOR combinations of the binary inputs. It was 
observed that the trained perceptron was able to segregate outputs 
originating from OR and AND with 100% accuracy using linear models,
 however, as expected, the linear model was unable to do so for 
 outputs originating from XOR input combinations.

Technology Used:

* Python 3

Libraries Used:
