Description:

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook showcasing the implementation of
 image morphological operations of Dilation and Erosion from scratch. These
  morphological operations have optimised implementations in the OpenCV
   library. However, a pure numpy based implementation from scratch exhibits
    the underlying algorithms in work when these operations are performed
    .  A comparison with the OpenCV implementation results are also done as
     a sanity check of the numpy based results.
     
The following links show movies of the morphological dilators and eroders in
 action on a 10x10 pixel grayscale image with a 3x3 ellipsoidal kernel.
