    "\n",
    "Video Stabilization approaches include mechanical, optical and digital stabilization methods. These are discussed briefly below:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Mechanical Video Stabilization**: Mechanical image stabilization systems use the motion detected by special sensors like gyros and accelerometers to move the image sensor to compensate for the motion of the camera.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Optical Video Stabilization**: In this method, instead of moving the entire camera, stabilization is achieved by moving parts of the lens. This method employs a moveable lens assembly that variably adjusts the path length of light as it travels through the camera’s lens system.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Digital Video Stabilization**:  This method does not require special sensors for estimating camera motion. There are three main steps — 1) motion estimation 2) motion smoothing, and 3) image composition. The transformation parameters between two consecutive frames are derived in the first stage. The second stage filters out unwanted motion and in the last stage the stabilized video is reconstructed."
