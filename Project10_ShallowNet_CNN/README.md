Description:

This repository contains source code, implementing a Python coded
 image classification software, that classifies animals from among
  3 classes [Cats, Dogs and Pandas] using Keras. The primary goal of this
   project is to implement a very simple, single layer, 32 filter Convoluted
    Neural Network architecture called the `ShallowNet` trained on the `Animals` dataset to
     differentiate between 3 classes of animals. The architecture and the
      dataset are courtesy of [Dr. Adrian Rosebrock](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/about/) 
      from PyImageSearch. The associated Jupyter file shows a cursory
       implementation of the model training, testing and prediction. The
