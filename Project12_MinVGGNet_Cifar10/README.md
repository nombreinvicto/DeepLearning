Description:

This repository contains source code, implementing a Python coded
CNN based image classification software, that classifies 10 classes of target
images using the Keras library. The primary goal of this project is to
 implement a very simple, `MinVGGNet` architecture 
    trained on the `Cifar-10` dataset to
     differentiate between 10 classes of targets. 
      The associated Jupyter file shows a cursory implementation of the
       model training, testing and prediction.

A normalisation regime consisting of periodic Batch Normalization and
 implementation of Dropout normalisation with 0.5 keep probability allowed
  the attainment of around 80% validation accuracy on the dataset with the
   `MinVGGNet` architecture.
