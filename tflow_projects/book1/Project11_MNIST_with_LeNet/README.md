Description:

This repository contains source code, implementing a Python coded
 CNN based image classification software, that classifies hand digits images
  using Keras
 . The primary goal of this
   project is to implement a very simple, 4 layer `LeNet` architecture 
    trained on the `MNSIT` dataset to
     differentiate between 10 classes of hand digits. The architecture and the
      dataset are courtesy of [Yann Lecun](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) . 
      The associated Jupyter file shows a cursory implementation of the
       model training, testing and prediction.
